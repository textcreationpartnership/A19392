            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if you ſhall ſay, that theſe things are to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred onely, as this Realme hath receiued the ſame, though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commaundement of God; then theſe words of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle following, <hi>viz.</hi> (As this Realme hath receiued the ſame, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the commaundement of God) conuinceth you of a ſlaunderous tongue againſt the whole ſtate and Church of God. For hereby you accuſe them of great impietie and vngodlineſſe, and attaint them of high treaſon, to the maieſtie of God, as though the intent of the whole ſtate were to haue the doctrine and Sacrament, and Diſcipline of Chriſt, miniſtred according to the commaundements of God; in caſe the lawes of the Realme, had ſo receiued the ſame, and not otherwiſe: And ſo to haue reſtrained the commaundements of God, by the lawes of the Realme, and ſo to haue concluded an impoſſibilitie, limiting and reſtraining the greater by the leſſe; and a lawe moſt perfect, by a lawe vnperfect, and not rather the contrary, to haue reſtrained in
<pb facs="tcp:22006:15"/> deede the leſſe by the greater: the lawes of the Realme, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God: an vnperfect law; the law of man, by a moſt perfect and abſolute law, the law of the moſt Higheſt: <label type="milestone">

Againe, in the ordering of Archbiſhops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, the Archbiſhop demaundeth of the Biſhop this queſtion. (Will you maintaine and ſet forward, as much as ſhall lye in you, quietnes, peace, and loue, amongſt all men: and ſuch as be vnquiet, diſobedient, and cryminous, within your Dioceſſe, correct, and puniſh, according to ſuch authoritie, as ye haue by Gods word, &amp; as to you ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the ordinaunce of this Realme?

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Pag. </seg>36</label> Surely, they can haue no ſuch interpretation. For the meaning of theſe wordes is, that euery Biſhop ſhould by the ordinaunce of the Realme, haue his office committed vnto him: and once hauing his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſo committed vnto him, by the ordinaunce of the Realme, then to correct and puniſh, according to ſuch authoritie, as he hath committed vnto him by Gods word, and as he is appointed by the ordinaunce of the Realme to execute. Neither hath the Biſhop any authoritie giuen him by theſe words, to correct, or puniſh any, otherwiſe then the lawes of God permit him; though the lawes of the Realme were not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the law of God. And in like caſe I conclude, that a Miniſter bound, as you haue ſeene before, to miniſter the Diſcipline of Chriſt, ought ſo to miniſter the ſame, as the Lord hath commaunded, though the lawes of the Realme ſhould not haue receiued the ſame. For no Diſcipline in truth can be ſayd to be the Diſcipline of Chriſt, vnleſſe it be in deede miniſtred, as the Lord Chriſt hath commaunded the ſame ſhould be miniſtred. And therefore, as no Biſhop may, or ought to correct or puniſh any tranſgreſſor, any otherwiſe then according to the lawes of God: ſo no miniſter ought to exerciſe any diſcipline, then ſuch as the Lord Chriſt hath commaunded. If it be alleadged, that our Diſcipline, vſed in the Church of England, be in very deede the very ſame Diſcipline which the Lorde Chriſt hath commaunded, (which is vtterly vntrue) as appeareth. Firſt and principally, by the word of God. Secondly, by the diſcourſes written, betweene the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, on that behalfe. Thirdly, by the Diſcipline practized by all the reformed Churches: and laſtly, by Maiſter Nowell his Catechiſme, commaunded generally by the Biſhop to be taught vnto the youth of
<pb facs="tcp:22006:16"/> the Realme, in all ſchooles of their Dioceſſe: yet notwithſtanding, the Miniſter, contrary to a vowe made by him, at the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Ordinarie, appointed therevnto by lawe, is very iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly dealt with, for that he is not permitted to exerciſe any diſcipline at all: our Biſhops and Archdeacons, challenging vnto themſelues a principall prerogatiue, to puniſh all malefactors, within their ſeuerall iuriſdictions. An other reaſon, that this ſtatute hath appointed, as well the diſcipline of Chriſt, as the doctrine and ſacraments to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, as the Lord commaunded onely, and none otherwiſe is this: namely, for that this ſtatute was made, to reforme as well the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered diſcipline, vſed in the time of popery, amongſt the popiſh idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Prieſts: as it was to reproue their falſe doctrine, and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the ſacraments: ſo that neither the one, neither the other, ſhould be miniſtred by the Miniſters of the Goſpell; for otherwiſe, this braunch of the ſtatute, ſhould ordaine nothing, and ſo contrary to the nature of a lawe, be <hi>Lex abſurda,</hi> an abſurd lawe. <label type="milestone">

No, no: Their proceedings appeare to be of greater wiſedome, knowledge, iudgement, diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and godlineſſe. They appointed, by the ſame their conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, three kindes of offices to be in the Church: Deacons, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Biſhops, appointing ſeuerally, to euery officer his ſeuerall dueties, and hath expreſly appoy nted reading homilies to be the office of a Deacon. For in the ordering of Deacono, the Biſhoppe, by vertue of the Statute, pronounceth theſe wordes vnto the Deacon.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Pag. </seg>40</label> And it is verily to be thought, the Biſhop himſelfe, will challenge as much vnto himſelfe, by this ſtatute, from the Miniſter; and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by this ſtatute, he alone hath authoritie to make Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and Miniſters, and to gouerne them: and that therefore it beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not a Miniſter, to be ordered otherwiſe, then according to the forme of the booke, and no otherwiſe to preach, then as he ſhall be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed therevnto, by him the Biſhop. As touching the Iniunctions, the aduertiſments, and the articles of religion, wherein mention is made ſometimes, that Parſons, Vicars, and Curates; ſometimes that the Miniſter ſhall reade Homilies, they may eaſily be reconciled by this ſtatute. For the Iniunctions ſet forth, primo Elizabeth. the aduertiſements and articles ſet forth, ſeptimo Elizabeth. and this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, being made 8.

For whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the names were vſed in them confuſedly; this ſtatute doth aptly diſtinguiſh them, applying properly euery proper office to his proper officer, and bringing thoſe names before recited vnto two principall heads.

Likewiſe, a Miniſter, if he be a Parſon, Vicar, or Curate, he muſt miniſter the doctrine, and ſacraments, and diſcipline of Chriſt: he muſt be a diſpenſor of the word of God; and he muſt
<pb facs="tcp:22006:17"/> preach onely, and yet in ſaying that he muſt preach onely, I doe not exclude him from doing thoſe other dueties, <hi>Sine quibus illud fieri non poteſt.</hi>

What, wil you then by law poſitiue barre all Miniſters, that be Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Vicars, or Curates, and yet cannot preach, from reading Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies?

And to the ende, you may ſee more apparantly, theſe two offices, by the law it ſelfe, to be thus diſtinguiſhed, I haue ſet downe the Biſhops words, pronounced by vertue of the ſtatute, vnto the Miniſters, as followeth. [You haue heard brethren, as well in your priuate examination, as in the exhortation, and in the holy leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons taken out of the Goſpell, and out of the writings of the Apoſtles, of what dignitie, and of how great importance this office is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto ye be called: &amp; moreouer, I exhort you in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to haue in remembrance into how high a dignitie, and to how chargeable an office ye be called: that is to ſay, to be the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, the watchmen, the Paſtors, and the ſtewards of the Lorde, to teach, to premoniſh, to feede, and prouide for the Lordes familie, to ſeeke for Chriſt his ſheepe, that be diſperſed abroad, and for his children which be in the middeſt of this naughty world, to be ſaued thorough Chriſt for euer: <label type="milestone">

Wherefore conſider with your ſelues, the ende of your miniſterie towards the children of God, toward the ſpouſe and body of Chriſt, and ſee that ye neuer ceaſe your labour, your care and diligence, vntill you haue done all that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in you, according to your bounden duetie, to bring all ſuch as are,
<pb facs="tcp:22006:18"/> or ſhall be committed to your charge, vnto that agreement in faith and knowledge of God, and to that ripeneſſe and perfectneſſe of age in Chriſt, that there be no place left among them, either for errour in religion, or for viciouſneſſe in life. As here you ſee the whole ſumme of the office of a Miniſter, recited by act of Parlement, and pronounced by the Biſhop: So in the whole action of ordering Miniſters, both the Biſhops interrogatories, and the parties anſweres, and all tende to admoniſh the Miniſter ſtill of his duetie, in teaching and inſtructing the people, and in preaching. Where the whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ordering Deacons, tendeth to admoniſh the Deacon of his office in reading: As thus. (Will you diligently reade the ſame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people aſſembled in the Church, where you ſhall be appointed to ſerue)</p>

And againe, (Take thou authoritie to execute the office of a Deacon, in the Church of God, and take thou authoritie to read the Goſpell in the Church of God.) And then one of them appointed by the Biſhop, ſhall reade the Goſpell of that day. And no doubt, the whole houſe of Parlement had a ſingular care to haue theſe offices diſtinguiſhed by their law, euen as they are diſtinguiſhed by the lawe of Chriſt himſelfe, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both by the places of Scripture, appoynted by the ſtatute to be read for euery office: And alſo by appoynting the prouiſion for the poore, vnto the Deacons. And furthermore, it is his office, ſayth the Biſhop by the ſame ſtatute, where prouiſion is ſo made, to ſearch for the ſicke, poore, and impotent people of the parriſh, and to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate their eſtates, names, and places where they dwell, to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that by his exhortation they be relieued by the parriſh, or other conuenient almes. And therefore I conclude againe, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop can no more appoynt the office of prouiſion for the poore, vnto a Miniſter, then he can change or alter an act of Parlement: And therefore, that he can no more commaund a Miniſter to read Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, then he can commaund him to make prouiſion for the poore. For as touching theſe words toward the latter ende of this action. (Take authoritie to preach where thou ſhalt be appointed:) Whereby they take hold, no otherwiſe to ſuffer them to preach, then as they ſhall be licenſed afterward by writing, hath neither head nor tayle. They make, by their fauourable pacience, a conſtruction thereof, without all ryme or reaſon.

<pb facs="tcp:22006:19"/> gate of my paſture, where my grey ambling gelding runneth, open the gate, bring him out, take him to your owne vſe: I giue him you frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hath he not as good a title and intereſt to my horſe, as if I had made him a bill of ſale, vnder my hande and ſeale? And hath not the Miniſter likewiſe, as well a ſpeciall licenſe, from a Biſhop, to preach, that is willed openly in the preſence of God, men, and angels: as he, that hath a ſpeciall licenſe giuen him alone in a corner: the one is pronounced, ſolemnly in the middeſt of the congregation: the other is done ſecretly, by a Gooſe quill. Moreouer, neither doth the foreſayd Canon, neither yet the Iniunction, require a ſpeciall licenſe in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to the ende, that the Miniſter ſhould haue power thereby onely to preach. For ſo ſhould you take away the forme and order, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by act of Parlement, whereby authoritie is giuen to a Miniſter to preach, and commit the making of a Miniſter, to the Biſhop, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a congregation. But the ende, why a ſpeciall licenſe, ought to be had, is not ſo much, for the partie himſelfe to preach within his owne cure, as for them, that ſhall admit him to preach out of his owne cure: And that appeareth manifeſtly by the eight article of the Iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The words are theſe. (Alſo that they ſhall admit no man within any their cures, but ſuch as ſhall appeare vnto them to be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly licenſed therevnto, &amp;c.) And in the ende of this Iniunction, it is expreſly permitted to euery Miniſter, to preache within his owne sure, though he be not ſpecially licenſed therevnto. <label type="milestone">

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a Miniſter to preach within his owne cure, yea though he haue no licenſe, is commaunded. In the time of Henry the 4. at what time Wickliffe preached the Goſpell, the very ſame lawes were eſtabliſhed againſt him, and his brethren, to ſtaye the courſe of the Goſpell: and yet were neuer any forbidden to preach in their owne parriſhes, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by that, that followeth.

Out of which concluſions, I collect this rule: Namely, that where a ſtatute ſhall eſtabliſh an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, practized and had in vſe before the making of the ſtatute, and ſhall require a calling, a tryall, an examination, and qualities in an officer, meete to execute that office, and ſhall not ſpecifie and declare any particular kind of calling, of tryall, of examination, and ſuch qualities, &amp;c. that then ſuch manner of calling, of tryall, of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and ſuch qualities, are required by that ſtatute, to be in ſuch an officer, as by common right were requiſite for ſuch an officer, before the making of that ſtatute. And becauſe by the viewe of the former order it ſelfe, it is very apparant that the ſame forme and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was appoynted, by men very deſirous to promote, as much as in them lay, the honour and glory of God, and to aboliſh all ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and trumperies brought into his Church: Therefore becauſe I ought by duetie, to conceiue their meaning to the beſt, and moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their profeſſion: I ſay, that they meant herein, onely ſuch calling, ſuch tryall, ſuch examination, and ſuch qualities, as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to be in a Deacon, and in a Miniſter, by the lawe of God. Which is euident both by the order of prayer, vſed at the time of their orderings, and alſo by the Scripture read for that purpoſe. The prayer followeth. (Almightie God, which by thy diuine prouidence, haſt appoynted diuers orders of Miniſters in the Church, and did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt inſpyre thyne holy Apoſtles, to chooſe vnto this order of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, the firſt Martyr S. Steuen, with other; mercifully behold theſe thy ſeruaunts, now called to the like office, and adminiſtration: <label type="milestone">

Amen.</p>
                     <p>After this prayer, followeth the Epiſtle out of Timothie. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, muſt the Miniſters be honeſt, not double tongued, not giuen to much wine, neither greedy of filthy lucre, but holding the miſterie of the faith with a true conſcience. And let them firſt be proued, and let them miniſter ſo that no man be able to reproue them. Euen ſo muſt their wiues be honeſt, not euill ſpeakers, but ſober and faithfull in all things. Let the Deacons be the huſbands of one wife, and ſuch as rule
<pb facs="tcp:22006:20"/> their children well, and their owne houſholds. For they that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter well, get themſelues a good degree, and a great libertie in the faith, which is in Ieſu Chriſt, &amp;c. or elſe this out of the ſixt of the Acts.</p>
                     <p>Then the twelue, called the multitude of the Diſciples together, and ſayd: It is not meete, that we ſhould leaue the word of God, and ſerue tables: wherefore brethren, looke ye out among you ſeuen men of honeſt report, and full of the holy Ghoſt and wiſedome, to whome we may commit this buſineſſe, but we will giue our ſelues to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall prayer, and to the adminiſtration of the word. And that ſaying pleaſed the whole multitude, and they choſe Steuen, a man full of faith, and full of the holy Ghoſt, and Philip, and Procorus, and Nica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a conuert of Antioche.

And who can be ſo void of reaſon or vnderſtanding, as to imagine, that men renued with the ſpirit of wiſedome, in the goſpell of Chriſt, ſhould be careful and diligent, in the choice of diſcreet and wiſe men, to be dealers for them, in matters pertaining to this tranſitorie life, and yet ſhould be remiſſe and negligent what guides they approue of, to conduct them in the waies of eternall life? Or that they ſhould be leſſe prouident ouer their ſpirits and ſoules, than ouer their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies and goodes? Euery man whether he be in the miniſterie, or out of the miniſterie, contrarie to the blind popiſh diſtinction of Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſpiritualtie, if he be a true beleeuer, is the ſeruant of Chriſt, and hath the ſpirit of Chriſt, and in the choice of his paſtour ſhall haue a ſpirit giuen vnto him, to diſcerne whether the ſame be a man apt to teach or no. The confuſion therfore ſo greatly feared by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh idolatours, is not once to be ſuſpected amongeſt Chriſtians. They had cauſe to feare and be affrighted, hauing put away faith and a good conſcience: But we haue boldnes, with confidence to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vnto our God, who is able, and will aſſuredly ſtay the rage of the people, and finiſh our actions, with a quiet and peaceable iſſue. And thus much of the face of the church, &amp; of the choice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people and Cleargie, to be had in the ordering of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Touching the Latine tongue required to be in euery Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as the lawes haue alwaies had reſpect to a competent and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient knowledge therein: ſo the Act of Parlement, made the 13. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zab. chap. 12. hath fully and at large expounded the ſame, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited the knowledge thereof in theſe words: <label type="milestone">

                        <p>And thus, as briefly as I could, I haue examined theſe words mentioned in the booke, <hi>videlicet,</hi> calling, tried, examined, knowne, qualities, the face of the Church, and the Latine tongue, what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſignification by lawes in force the ſame wordes haue. And alſo what order and forme our Biſhops ought by Law poſitiue to haue vſed in making Deacons, and Miniſters: and what cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite and fidelitie her Highneſſe, and the whole bodie of our Church,
<pb facs="tcp:22006:25"/> and common weale haue repoſed in them, for an orderly, vpright, and ſincere diſpoſition of theſe things. Vnto which truſt, howe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable their ſeruice and gouernement hath beene, I doubt not, but vppon their examinations they will approoue the ſame, to haue beene faithfull, iuſt, and equall. But by waie of ſuppoſition, if any ſhall denie their fidelities to haue beene ſuch as is pretended, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie then? or what is to be done then? Heerevnto I aunſwere: ſince the perill happening vnto others through their negligences in time paſt is vnrecouerable, that therefore the Lawe eſtabliſhed againſt ſuch exceſſes, would be executed in time to come: the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of one is a terrour to many, and by feare of puniſhment a man is made good.

For what though an Heretike, by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an hereticall Synagogue, obtaine the roome of a ſacrificer in the ſame Synagogue, and hauing once obtained it, may not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the ſame roome, by the former rule of lawe: Though this be true I ſay, what auaileth it to confirme, that a ſacrificing Prieſt, by vertue of his admiſſion vnto the Synagogue, ought to haue a place of miniſtration in the Church of Chriſt? For though he were admitted in the one, yet was he neuer admitted in the other. And therefore it reſteth firme, that they ought not to haue bene admitted then, when as the whole manner of the gouernment of the Synagogue ſhould haue bene altered. For as at that time, their lawes were vnaduiſedly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from them vnto vs: So by their lawes we might aduiſedly haue transformed them from amongſt vs. They were Schiſmatikes and Heretikes, by the lawes of our religion, and therefore not to haue bene admitted by the lawes of their owne profeſſion. Yea if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Idolaters ſtill, or keepe backe from the people of God the word of God, they are to be remoued ſtill: their ietting vp and downe in their ſquare ruffling and white philacteries, or mumbling their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens and euenſong, are not ſo forcible to keepe them in, as their inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie, negligence, contempt, and idolatrous hearts are to thruſt them out. And yet no part of good, holeſome, and chriſtian gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pollicie chaunged. For though Ioſiah, moued by compaſſion, benignly ſuffered the Prieſts of Baal (repenting of their idolatry) to receiue tithes and offerings with their brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Leuites: Yet he ſtraightly charged them not to enter into the Lords Sanctuary, to do any manner of ſeruice there: Neither did this his religious fact any whit hinder the outward peace of his kingdome.

For as the ſtatute hath limited a certayne order and forme of making Deacons and Miniſters: ſo hath it appoynted, that all that are made according to that order and forme, ſhould be in deede lawfull Deacons and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The wordes of the ſtatute are theſe. (And that all perſons, that haue bene, or ſhall be made, ordered or conſecrated Archbiſhop, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, Prieſts and Miniſters of Gods his holy word and ſacraments, or Deacons after the forme and order preſcribed in the ſayde order and forme, how Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Prieſts, Deacons and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould be conſecrated, made and ordered, be in very deede, and alſo by authoritie hereof declared and enacred to be and ſhal be Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Prieſts, Miniſters, &amp; Deacons, and rightly made, ordered, &amp; conſecrated, any ſtatute, lawe, Canon, or other thing to the contrarye nowwithſtanding.)

It followeth then, that if the firſt braunch of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute be broken, and that the forme and order be not obſerued, that the ſecond braunch can take no place: for that in deede the validitie of the latter, dependeth altogether vpon the obſeruation of the firſt.

And therefore, if the forme and order preſcribed by the booke, be not obſerued in making vnlearned Miniſters, I ſay then, that vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Miniſters, by law, are no Miniſters at all.

An example of this may be thus. Suppoſe that the Treaſurerſhip in Paules were voyd, and that her highneſſe had commaunded the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of London to prouide a fit man for the ſame roome; whether <note place="margin">De offic. dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat. lib. 6. c. ſi cui. &amp; ext. de offic. deleg. c. vlt.</note> now the Biſhop may commit this his charge, to be performed by an other, then by himſelfe or no? And it is anſwered negatiuely, becauſe in the choice of a fit perſon conſiſteth great danger, and therefore the Biſhop being but an executor of her Maieſties pleaſure, he may not ſubſtitute any other. But becauſe her highneſſe had commaunded the ſame Biſhop of London to haue giuen the ſame prebend to <hi>Lucius Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> whether then might the Biſhop in this caſe <hi>ſubdelegat Archdeacon Sempronius.</hi> And the anſwere is affirmatiue, that he might: for nowe her Maieſtie by hir ſelfe-hath nominated the partie to be placed, and hath not choſen the Biſhops induſtrie for that purpoſe, and therefore he may aſſigne this prouiſion vnto another. But it is otherwiſe, where the induſtrie of a Perſon is choſen, concerning one to be elected: for then, he may not ſet ouer that his office to any other. <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Pag. </seg>82</label> Now then out of theſe rules and lawes, I conclude, that ſithence it hath pleaſed the high court of Parlement, particularly and expreſly by name, to make choice of the Archdeacon, and hath perſonally qualified him, as their meeteſt man for this charge, choſing the induſtrie of his owne perſon, in preſenting fit men to be made Miniſters, or of his Deputies, in preſenting fit men to be made Deacons: and forſomuch alſo as in this action conſiſteth the publike benefit of the whole Church, and on the which hangeth the greateſt perill and daunger of the whole Church: For theſe cauſes I conclude, that an Archdeacon onely, muſt &amp; ought of neceſſitie preſent one to the Biſhop, to be made a Miniſter, &amp; that the Biſhop cannot diſpence with him in this caſe, and that neither the Biſhop, neither the Archdeacon, neither the partie to be made a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, neither the Clearks and people preſent, by their conſents, can alter or tranſpoſe any thing herein. <hi>Publica vtilitas eſt pars agens.</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">ff. de pact. l. in publicum.</note> vtilitie is the partie agent in this buſineſſe, and <hi>Pacta priuatorum iuri publico non derogant.</hi> The couenants and agreements of priuate men doth not derogate from common right. And if the contrary haue bene practized, what may be concluded thereof, ſhall follow immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly. And againe by theſe proofes you may euidently ſee, that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the triall, the examination, the time, the perſon appointed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and the age of one to be preſented, haue not bene things meere contingent, but rather eſſentiall, not <hi>cauſas ſine quibus non,</hi> but cauſes formall to the making of Deacons and Miniſters, and ſuch cauſes as being omitted, haue bene ſufficient cauſes both to depoſe from their

VVas the lawe of a whole Empire euer tied to the will of one man in a Dioceſſe? If the thing it ſelfe were not manifeſt to the viewe of the whole Realme: and that the vnlearned miniſters in euerie parte of the Realme were not glaſſes, to ſee theſe deformities by: and that the daily and lamentable complaints, in the eares of hir honorable councell, were not euident teſtimonies thereof: Yet were their owne regiſters and recordes thorowly peruſed, they would teach vs ſufficiently, that theſe things (yea and worſe too (if worſe may be) are neither fained nor forged.

For when ſoeuer any man ſhall make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund by vertue of that contract, inaſmuch as he doth demaund it, he doth it by deceit. As for example: ſuppoſe I haue bought in good faith, without colluſion of you, a peece of plate, for leſſe then the one halfe of the iuſt value thereof: as ſuppoſe for eight pound, which was worth twenty pound: afterwards I couenant with you ſimply, and you promiſe to deliuer me the ſame plate: in this caſe, if I ſue you for the deliuerie of the plate, you may vſe an exception of guile againſt me, becauſe I deale deceitfully in demaunding the performance of a contract, which in it ſelfe containeth iniquitie. For this contract it ſelfe is againſt the equitie of law, prouiding that a man ſhould not be ſo vnprouident in ſelling his goods, as to ſell them vnder the one halfe of the iuſt value. <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Pag. </seg>88</label> And therefore in this contract, being againſt law, appeareth a manifeſt iniquitie, becauſe the plate being worth 20. pounds, was ſold by you for eight pounds, a leſſe ſum then ten pound, halfe of the iuſt price, and therefore in it ſelfe by law without equitie: and therefore neither to be demaunded by me, neither to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by you. And to make this more plaine, and ſo to apply it to my purpoſe, <hi>bona fides,</hi> good faith, in this contract ought to be in this ſort: You for your part, and I for my part, and we both ought in truth to thinke and be of opinion, that you haue intereſt and right in the plate, and ſo power to alienate, and to ſell it vnto me. And therefore concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the contract made betweene the Biſhop and the partie, becauſe the Biſhop oftentimes knoweth the partie that is to be made a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter by him, to be a man altogether vnlearned, vnfit, and vnapt to
<pb facs="tcp:22006:34"/> execute his miniſterie duely, and therefore cannot thinke him to be a man quallified as were requiſite. And becauſe the partie that is to be made a Miniſter, knoweth himſelfe vtterly voyd of thoſe graces and gifts which ought to be in him, and therefore cannot beleeue him ſelfe to be truely called, or moued to that office by the holy Ghoſt. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they both knowe that there hath bene no ſuch calling, no ſuch tryall, no ſuch examination, no ſuch preſentation, &amp;c. As (by the forme and order of the booke) ſhould be, I ſay therefore that good faith wanting on both partes, this contract made coulourably betweene them is meerely voyde, and the one not bound by lawe to the other, to the performance of the ſame: and therefore much leſſe the common wealth, or the Church of Chriſt to tollerate their conſpiracie, or to beare with their colluſion. <hi>Non debet alterius colluſione aut inertia alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22006:69"/> therefore it is not lawfull for a common miniſter to procure another to preach for him; where his owne ſkill is not ſufficient.

For though want of learning may and ought to be a ſufficient cauſe to kéepe a man from preaching in his owne perſon, and to force him to ſupplie it by ſome other, though a verie ſlender ſkill will ſerue for the preaching which héere is ment; yet for not perſonallie viſiting: not that, but other lawfull impediments muſt be alledged, conſidering the like ſkill is not in the one as in the other required.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:22006:77"/> may as well admoniſh, denounce, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate offenders within his charge, as a Biſhop may within his dioceſſe.</hi> The firſt whereof perteining to teaching, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the miniſter, although it prooue not a neceſſarie coherence of preaching with the miniſterie, ſéeing manie beſides preachers, as the father, the maiſter, and the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, are to teach and inſtruct in godlineſſe, thoſe who are of their charge: yet is it more peculiarlie incident to the treatiſe here in handling, than the other obſeruation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning diſcipline. But ſhall we ſaie that this man is well aduiſed, in ſeeking to inſpire euerie miniſter with a power <note place="margin">The authors contrarietie.</note> to execute all diſcipline in the church, and that by law now in force? when as in a peculiar treatiſe of this booke, he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to prooue that by law <hi>Excommunication by one alone is forbidden;</hi> whereby he pulleth downe with one hand, that which he built with the other, and ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe either verie forgetfull, or paſſing inconſtant. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon I would be reſolued by the author or ſome other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thinke this endowment of euerie miniſter, with the execution of all diſcipline, admitting but not granting it to be ſo by law, to be a conuenient policie, for the vnitie and quiet of the church? And whether he himſelfe had not rather be vnder the forme now in practiſe, in regard of his owne contentment, than vnder the infinit dictatorſhip of his owne miniſter? Or elſe, whether ſhould appellations from the judgement of the miniſter in this reſpect be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of, and whether to the Biſhop, or to whome? And whether the Biſhop by this interpretation of law, ſhall not reteine his authoritie of executing the diſcipline of the church vpon euerie particular miniſter, and in euerie ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pariſh as aforetime, ſeeing the author ſaith <hi>As well as the Biſhop in his dioceſſe?</hi> And if he ſhall, what if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop vpon good cauſe, and for abuſing of the authoritie, ſhall ſuſpend the miniſter from his iuriſdiction of executing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline? Is he not at the ſame point he was at before? And what if the Biſhop himſelfe dwell in the pariſh, who ſhall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:22006:78"/> then haue the preheminence? And what if the miniſters diſcretion ſerue him, vpon ſome ſmall or ſurmiſed cauſe to excommunicate ſome great péere or noble counſellor of his pariſh, whoſe indignation may turne the whole church to great miſchéefe? Or to procéed againſt his patrone, who peraduenture hath a bond of him to reſigne? As manie couetous coruorants and <hi>Nimrods</hi> haue in theſe daies, whereby the miniſterie is more enthralled to the corrupt deuotion of one man, than by all the lawes that any waie may concerne them. The author ſéemeth to me to diuide the diſcipline of the church, which he would intitle euerie miniſter vnto, into admonition, denuntiation, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. If by denuntiation, he meane the publiſhing of excommunication done by himſelfe, then is it a part thereof: if (as I rather thinke) he meane the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée of procéeding vpon faults not publike, ſpecified in the 18. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> then is this common with the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vnto all other chriſtians, euen as admonition is being the firſt degrée. And where the miniſter is the partie offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and hath not preuailed neither by his admonition in priuate, nor his denuntiation before two or thrée; to whome ſhall he tell it in the third place, where he himſelfe hath the authoritie to excommunicate? But the power of binding and looſing, according to the word of God, and the cenſure of reproouing and ſharpe rebuking of publike offenders, which doo conteine indéed the whole diſcipline, ment to be attributed by this church of England vnto priuate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour miniſters, whie are they left out in this place? And whie did he not alſo yéeld vnto euerie miniſter, as well as excommunication, the cenſure alſo againſt obſtinate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, and of anathematiſme, ſuppoſed (by the beſt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) to be a higher cenſure than excommunication, and vſed when all hope of amendment is gone? And touching his ſecond queſtion, whereof onelie (as it ſéemeth) any doubt is made, <hi>Whether the doctrine, ſacraments, and the diſcipline be to be miniſtered ſimplie, as the Lord hath
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:22006:78"/> commanded, or elſe whether they be to be miniſtred one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie as this realme hath receiued the ſame without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God?</hi> I ſaie, that as this queſtion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious to this whole church, by inſinuating a iarre in thoſe points to be eſtabliſhed by our lawes, with <hi>The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God:</hi> ſo is it a verie captious and ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall queſtion <hi>A diuiſione,</hi> bicauſe he diuideth thoſe things <note place="margin">Inconſtant dealing in the author.</note> that not onelie the booke hath ioined togither, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe within ten lines afore, vpon the like copulatiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, vrged the like concurrence of two other ſeuerall members in this ſelfe-ſame ſentence. And for anſwer to the queſtion, I doo affirme that theſe thrée are to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, both as the Lord hath commanded, and as this realme according to the commandements of God hath receiued the ſame. So that the one of theſe clauſes ſhall not be vnderſtood, either to <hi>[limit or reſtraine:]</hi> the other as he vnſkilfullie thinketh may be obiected, nor yet <hi>Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiuelie,</hi> as though the law ment by authoritie hereof to eſtabliſh that the order in theſe things by the realme recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſhould be holden as agreable to the word of God: but muſt be taken <hi>Enunciatiuelie,</hi> to declare and affirme (for the further incouragement and comfort of thoſe who are to miniſter theſe things) that following the order by law eſtabliſhed, they ſhall doo agréeablie to Gods will. Not that it is to be thought that euerie ceremonie, forme, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance about theſe thrée things, are either in particularitie deliuered in ſcripture, (as this man hath not alone abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie fanſied) or that there in either this church or anie other is or can be tied to any ſuch certeine exact forme <hi>In hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſi</hi> as we terme it: but that certeine generall rules for <note place="margin">Articles of religion. 34. art.</note> ceremonies and gouernement, being there ſet downe, euerie church is to followe the ſaid rules, in ſuch particular maner as they ſhall iudge (all varietie of circumſtances weied) to be moſt fit for the editieng and gouerning of that people. For iudgement whereof, I thinke that waie ſureſt to follow, which hath had the beſt proofe and experience of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:22006:79"/> profitableneſſe, by longeſt continuance of time, and purer antiquitie, ſo that it be ſure, no commandement in the word to be to the contrarie. And where as he concludeth, though without premiſſes, that <hi>A Biſhop and a miniſter ought to miniſter the diſcipline of Chriſt, as the Lord hath commanded, though the lawes of the realme ſhould not haue receiued the ſame,</hi> &amp; afterward in plaine terms ſaith, <hi>That our diſcipline vſed in the church of England, is not the ſame which the Lord Chriſt hath commanded:</hi> he dooth firſt iuſtifie that ſlander of this church, which his queſtion afore <note place="margin">The authors ſlaunder of the whole eſtate.</note> did inſinuate. Secondlie, he directlie contrarieth both that which the booke by law eſtabliſhed, &amp; which he himſelfe had a little before affirmed in theſe words, <hi>That the diſcipline is to be executed by the Biſhop, as he hath committed vnto him by Gods word, &amp; as he is appointed by the ordinance of the realme to execute.</hi> Laſtlie he héereby both giueth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to Biſhop and miniſter, to vſe what forme ſo euer of diſcipline ſhall ſéeme to them grounded vpon Gods word, and dooth as it were crie an alarum to all men, to oppoſe <note place="margin">A ſeditious aſſeueration of the author.</note> themſelues againſt the diſcipline of this church, as wicked and not agréeable to Chriſts inſtitution. But let vs a little examine his proofes, whereby he goeth about to infer, that <hi>The diſcipline of the church of England is not according to the commandement of Chriſt.</hi> The firſt reaſon, that <hi>It appeareth by the word of God:</hi> and likewiſe the ſecond, that it ſo <hi>Appeareth alſo by the diſcourſes written by the learned to and fro,</hi> are two childiſh fallacies, <hi>A petitione principij,</hi> proouing a thing in doubt by a matter as much or more doubtfull, for who being of a contrarie opinion, will not ſtraight tell him, that his proofe is as euidentlie falſe as his concluſion. That which is ſaid of <hi>The diſcipline of all reformed churches,</hi> maketh more againſt him than he is ware of. Firſt, more reformed churches come néerer vnto our outward policie, diſcipline and ceremonies, than thoſe are in number who ſéeme to diſſent from vs. Againe, few or no reformed churches, eſpeciallie of ſeuerall nations or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:22006:79"/> dominions, doo iumpe in one externall policie of diſcipline or ceremonies. And whie is it not as lawfull for vs héerein to differ from them, as for them to differ amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? And how is it poſſible if ſuch a ſet forme (as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) be ſet downe in ſcripture, that they all differing ſo much one from another in externall policie, ſhould all be ordered therein according vnto the commandement of Chriſt? and thus to be brought as a ſquire to leuell vs by, who are alonelie belike in his fanſie wide from the right diſcipline: where as I ſée no cauſe in any reſpect, whie they ſhould not rather take light of vs, than we of them. That which he ſpeaketh of maiſter <hi>Nowels</hi> catechiſme, is verie generall, and requireth the peruſall of the whole booke. But I ſuppoſe this to be the place which he meaneth, where to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the latter end of the booke he ſaith: <hi>In</hi>

A foole fanſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that bels doo ring and almoſt ſpeake anie thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is delighted. Or could he gather, that maiſter <hi>Nowell</hi> here condemneth our churches diſcipline, as not agréeable to that which Chriſt hath commanded, if he had directlie ſaid that in ſome well ordered churches an order of diſcipline differing from ours is obſerued? Dooth this follow; Some well ordered churches differ in ſome points of externall diſcipline from our church, <hi>Ergo</hi> ours is not the diſcipline of Chriſt? Then by this reaſon ſhould no refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med churches be ſaid to reteine the diſcipline of Chriſt, or to be well ordered, manie of them vpon diuerſitie of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions differing euen from themſelues before, and euerie one in ſome point or other differing among themſelues.

And ſeeing he obiecteth vnto vs the preſident of reformed churches in matter of diſcipline, let him firſt by ſome proofe out of ſcripture, or ancient writers approoue vnto vs, if he can, the debarring of the ciuill magiſtrate from all gouernment in eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall cauſes, and a preſbyterie or ſegniorie conſiſting moſt of laie perſons; yet both of them practiſed by ſome churches, which he and his clients moſt admire: and as he ſhall deale in theſe, he ſhall haue more of our worke of like nature, which peraduenture will trouble the ſconſes of all the new diſcipline-framers we haue, to auow by good and ſubſtantiall proofes.

Forſooth bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>They permit not the miniſter to exerciſe any diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline at all.</hi> Yes truelie, as was touched afore, they doo and may execute the diſcipline of declaring by doctrine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God, mens ſinnes to be bound or looſed, and the cenſure of rebuking and reproouing openlie thoſe that doo fréeze in the dregs of their ſinnes, which are not the leaſt parts of diſcipline: which is as much (for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding of intollerable inconueniences which otherwiſe would enſue) as is expedient to be attributed vnto euerie one, and ſo is it all which the law dooth enable them with: as may be eaſilie gathered out of the verie ſame demand of the Biſhop: for at the latter end thereof it is ſaid; <hi>So that you may Teach the people committed to your care and charge with all diligence to keepe and obſerue the ſame;</hi> ſo that the diſcipline which the miniſter is to execute, reacheth no further, than to <hi>Teach</hi> his pariſh with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to kéepe and obſerue ſo much of the doctrine, ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and diſcipline of Chriſt, as apperteineth to them. And if no eſpeciall preheminence might be attributed in matter of execution of diſcipline to one miniſter aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: why is it ſaid by S. <hi>Paule,</hi> excommunicating, the inceſtuous Corinthian, <hi>Abſens decreui,</hi> being abſent I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créed, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 5.</note> ſeeing they had miniſters of their owne, and willed the denuntiation of the ſaid excommunication afterward to be doone openlie in the church? And at the time of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, <hi>Paule</hi> being abſent ſaith, To whom you forgiue any thing, I forgiue alſo. Likewiſe ſpeaking of the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiſme of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander:</hi> I haue giuen <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> them vp vnto ſathan, not naming either their owne mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or anie ſegniorie. But we muſt yet a little fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe our author leaping backe for <hi>Another reaſon,</hi> to prooue that <hi>This ſtatute hath appointed the diſcipline of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:22006:81"/> Chriſt to be miniſtred as the Lord commanded onlie, and none otherwiſe:</hi> which we will eaſilie grant him, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it in a generalitie, &amp; not as though euerie parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ceremonie, rite or circumſtance of externall policie, if they had beene (as they are not) in ſcripture mentioned (but being not commanded) were at an inch to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For elſe how could the primitiue church without any preſcript word (I doo not onelie ſaie haue brought in a new ceremonie) but haue altered the ſabboth daie by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at the firſt, and being our ſaturdaie, vnto the firſt daie of the wéeke in ſcripture twiſe or thriſe called the Lords daie, and with vs ſundaie: or yet the time of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſacrament of the euchariſt, being according to the inſtitution vſuallie receiued after ſupper, to haue it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued as it is in the morning faſting? His reaſon for the proofe of this concluſion I gather vp thus: <hi>If this part of the booke doo not abrogate all diſcipline vſed in time of poperie, amongſt the idolatrous prieſts, as well as their falſe doctrine and prophanation of the ſacraments, then dooth it ordeine nothing: but it dooth ordeine ſomething, or elſe it were an abſurd law: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it abrogateth diſcipline vſed in poperie.</hi> If this concluſion were granted, yet his matter he hath in hand would not here vpon be prooued; to wit, That therefore diſcipline is no otherwiſe to be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, than the Lord Chriſt hath commanded. But I haue ſhewed afore this Minor to be falſe, and that thoſe words of the Biſhop doo not diſpoſitiuelie ordeine or abrogate anie thing for diſcipline, more than they doo for the doctrine or ſacraments which were prouided for by other acts, and not by theſe words, which were indéed abſurd once to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Alſo his Maior foloweth by no conſecution: for it might haue béene that thoſe words had ordeined ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet not to haue abrogated all the diſcipline vſed in poperie, except it had by him firſt béene ſhewed, that the ſame was contrarie to the commandement of the Lord, and otherwiſe than this realme hath receiued it. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:22006:81"/> not prooued, we may conclude, that he hath in all this ſection plaied vpon the <hi>Petitio principij,</hi> a fallacie not fit for his perſon pretending ſome learning, and too plaine for a man to be ouerſéene in. And therefore in his concluſion hereof, he might haue ſpared his vehement expoſtulation of <hi>[Open wrong, and intollerable iniurie by the cheefe</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A proud and inſolent terme, full of phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</note>

If actiuelie, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie miniſter without checke might haue the execution of all diſcipline in his owne pariſh, I doo verelie beléeue, that this man and others, who ſo earneſtlie call for they know not what, if they might not be themſelues alſo elders, anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, or what you will, ſauing prieſts of the ſegniorie, would be the firſt wearie of it. For if I knowe their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition any thing, they are as vnpatient as any men, to be at controllement, and moſt of all by a poore miniſter.</p>

One reaſon for proofe of this he bringeth; ſéeing <hi>Three kinds of offices are appointed to be in the church, deacons, miniſters and Biſhops: eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie officer hauing his ſeuerall dutie expreſſelie appointed, as reading homilies, to be the office of a deacon:</hi> that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>One priuate man and fellowe-ſeruant may not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe from his fellowe-ſeruant, an office committed vnto him by publike authoritie,</hi> which he inforceth by this, that <hi>Statute law is Stricti iuris, and may not be extended.</hi> Here I will alſo aſke him a queſtion, ſéeing his worſhip will not permit to <hi>His lordſhip,</hi> that which no Biſhop neuer went about to doo of his own head and authoritie; Whether dooth he permit vnto hir Maieſtie (notwithſtanding this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of offices and ſtrictnes of ſtatute law which full wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he alledgeth) any power to take the reading of homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which he will néeds appropriate to a deacon, and to laie it alſo vpon euerie miniſter? If he will be ſo good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hir Highnes, as to grant hir this libertie, it may pleaſe him beſides the fourth iniunction before alledged to peruſe the 27. and 53. iniunctions, where expreſſelie all parſons, vicars, and curats, are inioined to read ſome homilie when there is no ſermon, whom I truſt he will not therfore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, either to be all deacons, or to tranſpoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out authoritie the office of their fellow-ſeruant vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. But to tie the reading of homilies vnto deacons, is ſo farre from all apparance or colour of truth, that in the ſelfe-ſame place, where he curtailed rather than abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the office of the deacon, the booke ſetteth downe: that it is a part of the deacons office to read holie ſcriptures and homilies in the church, <hi>Where he ſhall be appointed to aſſiſt the prieſt,</hi> not thereby that the prieſt is excluded from reading ſcriptures and homilies, if he ſo thinke good, or be commanded, and therefore much leſſe where no ſuch dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con is appointed to aſſiſt the prieſt. And if this new topike
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:22006:83"/> place were allowable, then hereof we might reaſon thus: Biſhops (as this man hath confeſſed afore) by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the realme are to execute diſcipline; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour <note place="margin">His argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt himſelfe.</note> miniſter being another diſtinct officer, may not tranſpoſe it to himſelfe, as in the other ſection he auouched. Alſo, miniſters are to preach; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Biſhops being of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct office may not preach, contrarie to all that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath ſpoken againſt dumbe prelats. Againe, <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons are by their office by law ſet downe to inſtruct the youth in the catechiſme, to baptiſe and to preach, if they be admitted thereto by the Biſhop; Ergo,</hi> miniſters being a diſtinct office from deacons (and ſtatutes being ſtrictlie to be interpreted) are neither to catechiſe, baptiſe nor preach by his owne doctrine, and where is then his learned mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie? <hi>And therefore I take it that I may ſafelie conclude without offenſe to his</hi> wiſedome, that either héere he doa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or elſe he hoped his readers would be ſuch affectionate dotards, as that he might with anie ſhew or vizard of likelihod as héere, or by racking, wringing, wreſting, and curtailing, as in diuerſe places elſe-where, without their further looking vnto him how plainelie he dolte, eaſilie abuſe them.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:22006:84"/> and preamble, that the forme and maner of making and conſecrating Biſhops, prieſts, and deacons, was not deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then anew, but was put in vre and eſtabliſhed in the daies of king <hi>Edward.</hi> And though <hi>Ad maiorem cautelam,</hi> for the auoiding of cauils, of traitorous and ſlanderous papiſts, the ſame booke was then eſtabliſhed by that act of parlement, yet dooth it in the preamble thereof, by manie reaſons prooue, that the ſaid booke had the force of law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

And where our author had ſaid, that <hi>A miniſter muſt miniſter the doctrine and ſacraments, and diſcipline of Chriſt;</hi> what néeded he to haue added <hi>And preach onelie,</hi> if (as afore he would haue inforced) vnder <hi>Doctrine or teaching,</hi> preaching be neceſſarilie alwaies emploied?

And if he will needs read the ſcriptures publikelie, whie ſhould he be ſuffered (by this mans conſtruction) to inuade <hi>The deacons proper office, and to tranſpoſe it to himſelfe?</hi> And therefore the copie of the ſupplication and ſubmiſſion of the Biſhops, which he hath here drawne in their behalfe, as though through their <hi>[Abuſing of hir High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe lawes]</hi> no meanes according to law could be found, for reading of homilies, where the miniſter is no preacher,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:22006:85"/> but by a deacon; he may well ſpare till they haue nèed of it: at which time peraduenture they will procure a better clearke than he is to pen it. Yet hèerein alſo either he or his printer hath vſed a prettie cunning, by prefixing there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Latine beginning, and vſing for fiue or ſixe lines an Italian letter, differing from the other Romane, bèelike to the intent that ſome ſimple credulous creature might belèeue this to be an allegation out of ſome law, which are vſuallie printed in this his booke in the ſame letter. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon which he bringeth for further proofe of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible diſtinction, of that part of the deacons office, which is in reading of homilies, from the miniſters office, as I conceiue it, is to this effect. All things about the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the miniſter, tend to admoniſh him of his dutie in teaching and inſtructing the people, and in preaching: But the whole action of ordering deacons, tendeth to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him of his office in reading: <hi>Ergo,</hi> a miniſter may not be forced to read homilies in the church.

The other argument brought in the laſt place, <hi>Whereas (in king Henrie the fourths time) reſtraints were made for preaching, and yet none were forbidden to preach in their owne pariſhes;</hi> that therefore in their owne cures none now are or ought to be forbidden: is a verie féeble reaſon. Firſt, there is a great difference betwixt <hi>Not licenced and forbidden.</hi> Againe, <hi>Viueudum est,</hi> we muſt liue according to our owne lawes now, and not by examples forepaſt. Further it commeth néereſt to a reaſon <hi>A ſimili,</hi> but then it ſhould conclude, that as they ought not, ſo neither ought we. And not thus, They did not forbid it, therefore we may not forbid it. And here alſo he driueth vs like water ſpaniels to ſéeke out once againe, where we may find that, which perhaps he was not willing we ſhould hit of.

For in the next words following his firſt allegation, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined an exception, whereby (vpon occaſion) beneficed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may by the Biſhop be inhibited or ſuſpended from preaching or expounding euen in their owne cures. And if it were not ſo, then this being but a prouinciall conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which cannot derogate from the canon law, afore in this ſection alledged by our author, ſhould be meerelie void. Yet to make it more plaine, what great doughtie ſermons theſe were, which beneficed perſons in their owne cures were (in this great reſtraint pretended) ſuffered to vtter: Forſooth they were nothing but that ſhallowe paraphraſe <note n="*" place="margin">Conſt. prou. ignorantia ſacerdotum de off.

And therefore this is farre inough from giuing any authoritie to all miniſters to intermeddle with preaching, without further licence than their ordination to the miniſterie. The obiection, which to this purpoſe againſt the author might be brought out of the aduertiſements, he handleth as <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> did <hi>Gordius</hi> knot, which bicauſe he could not handſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vntie, he hewed it in ſunder with his ſword. And ſo dooth he, by denieng the authoritie of them, bicauſe they are not with priuiledge, nor printed by the Quéenes printer, although they were commanded by hir Maieſties expreſſe letters. And is any man to ſurmiſe, that thoſe reuerend and wiſe Fathers, who ſubſcribed vnto the ſaid booke of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſements, would or durſt publiſh them in hir Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties name, and as by hir Highneſſe authoritie and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:22006:88"/> dafed ſuch a certeine daie, if it were not ſo: or that they would enterpriſe to forbid or reſtraine that which the law had ſo exactlie charged and commanded, as this man dreameth? But it is the guiſe of little children, where they cannot read, there to ſkip ouer. But this matter is cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie determined by a later <note n="*" place="margin">13.

And if the exhortation ſpoken of, could giue anie colour that waie, it ſhould haue béene to ſet out what héed and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant care the people ſhould haue, and what eſpeciallie they ſhould reſpect in the choice of their miniſter, rather than to tell them how they ought te ſtéeme him when he is once admitted; for if they themſelues make choiſe of them, there is no cauſe why of all other they ſhould miſlike, or make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie light reckoning of them, otherwiſe than men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie doo, who thinke they may make bold with ſuch as they themſelues haue aduanced. And whereas he would thereof gather the preſence of the people of that pariſh,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:22006:96"/> where the miniſter is to be placed, to be required, for that no profit elſe for the better eſtimation of their miniſter, can by them be reped of that exhortation: if it ſhuld be granted vnto him, can he ground vpon their preſence an intereſt alſo in them of approbation and election of their miniſter? But there is profit to be reped by ſuch an exhortation for any people whoſoeuer that ſhall be preſent. For euerie man is or ought to be of ſome pariſh, and hath a miniſter whom he ought to eſtéeme and reuerence for his calling ſake: and therefore ſuch exhortation can not be ſaid to be in vaine, though the people of the pariſh where he is to ſerue, be not then preſent.

But where he would conclude a neceſſarie preſence of more people than the Biſhops owne ſeruants at ordinations of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, bicauſe by law domeſticall folke are no fit witneſſes in a matter not domeſticall: he ſheweth as often afore he hath doone, rather a deſire to ſéeme to haue read ſome law, than a care truclie to vnderſtand, or aright to applie it.

Which is not to ſhew what is decreed in the word of God in any of theſe controuerſed points, but what is by canons, conſtitutions, and ſynodals prouinciall in force amongſt vs. And therefore if this of pope <hi>Adrians,</hi> or any other to like effect were not to the hurt of the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue roſall, nor repugnant to the lawes and cuſtomes of this realme, but had béene put in vre and practiſe before the making of that ſtatute: it might according to our authors foundation, ſtand for law ſtill in this land, though it were <note place="margin">25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> not conſonant to the word of God. Which I bring to ſhew the authors wandring from his iſſue, and not in any ſuch reſpect, as though this his allegation might otherwiſe haue ſerued his turne. For it is manifeſt, that it cannot: bicauſe that courſe of election mentioned in the <hi>Acts,</hi> was not vndertaken, for ſatiſfieng of any expreſſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt; but vpon an eſpeciall occaſion of a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the Gréekes againſt the Hebrues; for that their wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes (as ſeeming to be diſtruſted or contemned) were in the adminiſtration of the common church ſtocke ouer-paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: whereas the canons brought for proofe of excluding the multitude from elections, were not grounded vpon anie one particular occaſion, but of the nature of the people, and exigence of the cauſe it ſelfe.

The ſtatutes which he ſpeaketh of, are written <hi>In principio libri paulo post finem capitulo nuſquam:</hi> and ſhall be anſwered when any ſuch be framed. His reaſon, to prooue them contrarie to the cuſtomes of the realme, is thus: <hi>The greateſt number of voices, of ſuch as haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,</hi>

Indeed, he might haue gathered, <hi>Ergo,</hi> our maner of electing miniſters now in England, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the cuſtomes of chooſing maiors, &amp;c.

But euerie child may ſee the groſſe abſurditie of this reaſon, and he himſelfe if he haue not rubbed his forehead excéedinglie, will be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of it. And beſides the follie of his argument, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent <note place="margin">His reaſon retorted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</note> maketh againſt himſelfe. For it is notorious, that in cities &amp; townes, not euerie one that is to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hath voice in electing their officers; but certeine which be culled out of the reſt, and ſpeciallie truſted. So is there none admitted to the election of knights of the ſhires, but <hi>Legales homines,</hi> which may diſpend xl. ſhillings in land of freehold by the yéere. And yet manie beſides are intereſſed therein, and may be preiudiced therby, as being to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the one ſort, or to be tied to ſuch ſtatutes, as by the conſents of the other are paſſed. If therefore in theſe actions for auoiding of ſtirres and confuſions, elections were put into a few mens hands; much more reaſon was it, that the multitude ſhould not haue ſtroake in election of miniſters, being for the moſt part vtterlie vnable to iudge of their ſufficiencie in learning, which is the cheefeſt thing to be reſpected, but yet not debarred to obiect what they can againſt their conuerſation. It maketh flatlie againſt himſelfe in this alſo: bicauſe héere he ſéemeth to require no other conſent for election of miniſters, than is vſuallie in moſt cities and townes in the choiſe of their officers, being doone by the greater part of a few, in reſpect of the <note place="margin">Pag. 60. Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the author.</note> whole multitude beſides, contrarie to the rule of law by him before brought; <hi>That which toucheth all, muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:22006:100"/> of all and euerie one:</hi> and contrarie to that which here he ſaith, that <hi>All the faithfull of the land haue an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in choiſe and allowance of their paſtors.</hi> So that by this reckoning, men, women, and children (for all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full be intereſſed) ſhall haue voices in election of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; and if one diſſent, all muſt be daſhed, if we follow that rule.</p>
                     <p>And that this was the meaning of thoſe that confirmed the booke of ordering, he prooueth; bicauſe they <hi>Being men renewed with the ſpirit of wiſdome in the goſpell of Chriſt, would be as carefull, what guides they approoued of for conduction to eternall life, as for diſcreet dealers for them in matters of this life, and as prouident ouer their ſoules as ouer their goods.</hi> Indéed if all they had béene of this mans ſpirit, who peraduenture thinketh himſelfe as wiſe and learned as any, and nothing any waie touching him, to be well done which he dooth not himſelfe; this might then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſome ſhew, to haue béene reſpected. But thoſe that be modeſtlie wiſe, and with humilitie haue learned <hi>Sapere ad ſobrietatem,</hi> doo thinke, that one learned man, long ſtudied in the ſcriptures, and all good learning, is better able to iudge of the abilitie and ſufficiencie of any in that ſtudie; than ten thouſand other, though neuer ſo wiſe, yet not ſo déepelie ſtudied in thoſe matters. We beléeue one ſkilfull lawier in a point of lawe, and one expert phyſician for the ſtate of our bodie; better than we doo all the world beſides of ſuch as haue not either at all, or but ſlenderlie waded in thoſe profeſſions.

Or ſhall we ſaie, that none knoweth any thing, nor is able to catechize, or to exhort or dehort in any reaſonable meaſure, but he that is a preacher publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie licenced?

But the two <hi>Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities</hi> are as ſlenderlie beholding vnto him for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious report of them, as he was to either of them, which could purchaſe there no more ſound reaſoning nor modeſtie than in this booke is ſhewed.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:22006:122"/> Which point, if it were of ſubſtance, might no doubt in manie places reach as well vnto the preiudice of good and learned miniſters, as of vnlearned. But what reaſon were there, that the miniſter ſhould be puniſhed for the archdeacons neglect of his dutie? Or of whome ſhould he inquire, if he knew him not, whether he were the verie archdeacon, or but his deputie? Or whie ſhould we thinke that the deputie may not be as ſufficient to preſent them to the Biſhop, as the archdeacon himſelf? Or whie are we to imagine, ſéeing the booke preſumeth for the moſt part, both the order of deacon to ſome, and of prieſthood to other ſome, to be giuen in one daie, that the archdeacon being preſent, would depute one to preſent deacons, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in perſon preſent the prieſts? And what if the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall church haue no archdeacon eſtabliſhed there, or the archdeaconrie be void, or he himſelfe bed-rid; ſhall the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop (diuerſe places of miniſtration being vold in the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe) ſtaie the ordering of miniſters for thoſe void roomes, till there be a new archdeacon? And what if the Biſhop doo ſo ſufficientlie know them, or doo examine them himſelfe, that the archdeacon dooth not examine them, what néed is there then for him to preſent them? Or whie is this more of ſubſtance than the Biſhops <hi>Sitting in a chaire,</hi> when the oth of ſupremacie is miniſtred, which the Booke mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; or to order at the leaſt thrée at a tune: ſéeing the booke ſaith; <hi>The archdeacon ſhall preſent vnto the Biſhop all them that ſhall receiue the order of prieſthood that daie,</hi> which cannot be ſpoken of fewer than of thrée? Or if none but the archdeacon might preſent miniſters, without ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe of the whole action, why did not the booke ſaie; <hi>The archdeacon himſelfe, and none other ſhall preſent.</hi> And ſéeing it is ſaid otherwiſe, the act in law ſhall be good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, as hath beene ſhewed before.

I doo anſwer, that except he can both prooue all ſuch (whoſe omiſſion he would inforce to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe the whole action) to be eſſentiall; and alſo thoſe other circumſtances to concur, which in the end of the next ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſauing one afore, I haue ſhewed to be required to the adnulling of an act for want of forme, we muſt ſtill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt them for lawfull miniſters in the church. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Biſhop, who omitteth any of thoſe which be of moment, may be puniſhed: yet I for my part cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt any point of the ordination to be the formall cauſe of the externall calling into the miniſterie, beſides the words, giuing the authoritie to execute that function, and the two neceſſarie ſolemnities of praier, and the impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands. I doo obſerue in this ſection, that he or his printer to gratifie him, hath twiſe changed the forme of the letter from <hi>Romane</hi> vnto <hi>Italian,</hi> as though they were not the authors onelie words, but ſome allegation. Alſo, that among thoſe things which he would neceſſarilie haue the Biſhop to haue regard vnto, and not to omit at ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he reckoneth this: that the miniſter be mooued by <hi>the Holie-ghoſt,</hi> and be <hi>perſuaded of the ſufficiencie of ſcripture to ſaluation,</hi> and ſurmiſeth (verie vncharitablie) theſe to be wanting in <hi>Too too manie of our miniſters,</hi> which no man, but the ſpirit of the man himſelfe, which is within him, can iudge: ſo ſoone is he lept into Gods owne
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:22006:124"/> throne; and faketh vpon him, to ſet downe what lieth hid in a mans owne conſcience. Likewiſe is that of his ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, where he blameth the Biſhop for ordering him, that is not example to his flocke, or will not teach, &amp;c: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering it is not poſſible for the Biſhop to propheſie, how the miniſter will behaue himſelfe in his function after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And the booke preſcribeth not theſe as qualities to be attended before the ordination: but as ſolemne vowes and promiſes before God and his congregation: the more ſtrictlie to tie the miniſter vnto the fulfilling of his dutie. And ſo is this as fooliſh and wandring, where he ſaith, <hi>The vnlearned miniſters, the complaints to the Councell, &amp; the Biſhops owne records, are glaſſes, where in wee may ſee</hi> theſe omiſſions of forme and maner at ordinations not to be feigned. I doo thinke verie few complaints haue béene made for not obſeruing the forme of the booke, and fewer circumſtances omitted (I am ſure) are recorded. Touching his Daior propoſition of his ſyllogiſme, <hi>That the forme not obſerued by him, which had no authoritie before that booke of ordering was by law confirmed,</hi> except he meane it, that they had no authoritie before to make them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that forme, is moſt apparentlie falſe, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled by infinit lawes and canons, which endow them with this authoritie, as incident vnto their dignitie, euen from the apoſtles times downeward.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:22006:126"/> a ſetled and aduiſed purpoſe, that he hath to performe his dutie in the miniſterie, according to that his publike teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and vow.

                     <p>If it were any otherwiſe, I praie you what action for the proſecution of any priuate intereſt, dooth lie for the Biſhop againſt ſuch a miniſter as kéepeth not ſuch his promiſes, whereby the ſtipulation ſurmiſed ſhould be committed or forfeited? Furthermore, the other part of his Minor, which ſurmiſeth guile and deceit to be both on the part and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of <hi>The miniſter, as knowing him ſelfe void of thoſe gifts which ought to be in him, whereby he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue himſelfe to be trulie called or mooued by the Holie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſt:</hi> and alſo on the part of <hi>The Biſhop, as knowing the partie to be a man altogither vnfit for the miniſterie is lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be denied.</hi> And if (as he ſaith) guile and deceit be on both parts, then dooth he ſtriue againſt himſelfe, bicauſe then the action ſhall ſtand good, <hi>Quia dolus dolo compenſatur,</hi> one guile muſt be ſet againſt another, and neither on the one part, or the other ſhall the contract be ouerthrowne.

For the firſt, when he or any other hath prooued, euerie miniſter which is not qualified ſufficientlie to preach, of neceſſitie to be an <hi>Hypocrite, a falſifier of his word, an impious and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious perſon, an open mocker and deluder both of the law of God, and of hir Maieſties lawes;</hi> then will that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop he meaneth, be as readie to depoſe ſuch a one; as he was dutifull to ſée the obſtinate contempt and breach of hir Maieſties lawes puniſhed by impriſonment in him, whome this man calleth <hi>Honeſt, poore, faithfull watchman of the Lord, and painefull teacher:</hi> who neuertheleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was as farre from deſert of any of theſe commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, as the moſt of them, at whome he ſo viperouſlie hiſſeth; and as worthie for anie ſtuffe or learning, to be ſent againe to the plough handle, or weauers loome, as any of thoſe, whome he with ſuch gall and bitterneſſe dooth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute.

One is, bicauſe the Biſhops office is <hi>More paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full than gainefull, and he that taſteth the ſweet, ought alſo to taſt of the ſowre.</hi> Therefore he ſhould refuſe to admit any not ſo qualified, as our author meaneth, vnto a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: yea though he were ſure that after all his trouble and expenſes, ſuch a clearke ſhould be placed by the courſe of the common law, maugre his beard. So that by this mans accompt, it is better purpoſelie without cauſe or hope of preuailing for a man to trouble himſelfe and ſpend his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, than to be quiet: and better to riſe vp and fall, than to ſit ſtill. Naie, with what credit can the Biſhop reiect a man as vnable, whome he is ſure the law of the land will repute ſufficient? Therefore it is maruell that our author, vpon this colour, did not here runne into a common place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the common law, which is more looſe in allowance of clearkes vnto benefices, than he would beare vs in hand the canon law is. But <hi>Latet anguis in herba,</hi> There is a pad in the ſtraw. The next anſwer, that if the Biſhop ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine any hurt by refuſing to admit to a benefice an inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:22006:139"/> man, the blame is to be imputed vnto no man but himſelfe, which ordeined him: is the ſame with that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, whervpon he afterward relieth, though here he ſaith; <hi>He will let it paſſe.</hi> Laſtlie, he telleth vs he will alſo let paſſeth exhortation, which the <hi>Biſhops canons</hi> doo preſcribe to be vſed vnto patrones to perſuade them to beſtow their benefices ſincerelie, and vpon ſufficient men: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed he might with better diſcretion neuer haue named. For alas! is the Biſhop giuing a good and wholeſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the patrone, to be found fault with, bicauſe the patrone hauing his hand on his halfepenie, will not ſuffer himſelfe to be perſuaded by him, to doo as he ought? But he alledgeth in defenſe and fauor of a <hi>Patrone preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an vnlearned man to a benefice,</hi> that he is not to be blamed by the Biſhop, but himſelfe is to be chieſlie burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and blamed, who ordeined ſuch a one miniſter: and the rather bicauſe <hi>The benefice is due by reaſon of the office.</hi> Yet the Biſhops blame and reprehenſion cleareth not the patrones couetouſneſſe, his want of zeale, to haue the people as well taught as he might, his theft, his ſacrilege, his ſimonie, his abbetting and procuring of another man to be periured for his owne lucre. For there is none of them ſo ſimple, but they well know, that theſe are thus by law condemned. And what by themſelues, and what by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (at leaſt when the Biſhop vpon examination dooth find it ſo) they might take knowledge that a more learned and ſufficient man might be eaſilie procured, who would accept it thankfullie: which bicauſe the patrone cannot breake his faſt with, he therefore will not be remooued from him that hath moſt ſlender gifts of mind, bicauſe ſuch a man hauing little elſe to commend him, will be content to depart with the greateſt gifts to the patrons purſſe and kitchin. And yet may it not fall out, that the Biſhop vpon good conſideration may refuſe to admit him to a benefice, whome he hath afore receiued into the miniſterie? For perhaps he may be fit for ſome ſmall charge and liuing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:22006:140"/> (which a man of greater gifts will not accept of though he be not fit for a more populous pariſh, being a ſufficient maintenance for a more excellent man.

As for the promiſe of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the patrone, it is a thing in fact, and preſumed not lightlie onelie, but alſo vainclie by the author, being more probable that the patrone, if he were ſo deſirous of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons continuall companie, would bind him ſure inough from ſtarting; yet if it were made and broken, the foulneſſe

That which he ſaith of non reſidence ſimplie to be both againſt the law of man and ordinance of God, remaineth more aptlie to be diſcuſſed in another place. But as touching the conſent of the people, who no doubt giue a verie free conſent to allow well of him, whom their patrone liketh for his gaines ſake, and whome they dare not miſlike for feare of the patrones diſpleaſure: as it is neither required by Gods nor mans law, ſo dooth it make nothing at all to the qualifieng or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating of the edge of Gods wrath, againſt this deteſtable ſinne of <hi>Simonie,</hi> and church-robbing.

Wherevpon this will enſue, and profitablie may be gathered: that as it is lawfull for any particular church by the word of God, to reteine what forme and circumſtances of diſcipline and gouernement in the church, not contrarie to the word of God, which (weieng all things therein conſiderable) ſhall be thought moſt to tend, then and there, to the building vp of the liuelie ſtones in déed, into one accouplement in Chriſt Ieſus his myſticall bodie: ſo that forme will fall out to be moſt ſafe, which hath béene moſt generallie recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and profitable practiſed, and hath for it, the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the pureſt antiquitie in the primitiue church. For it is a verie nice and a dangerous ſcrupuloſitie, rather than to vſe that aright, which hath bene once abuſed; that a man
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:22006:147"/> ſhould go about to deuiſe, and to laie out new platformes in church matters, in which of neceſſitie ſuch difficulties will dailie ariſe, that can not by any reach of mans wit be forecaſt, and which will bréed not onelie a continuall toile, but alſo infinite dangerous innouations, both in the church and common-weale. Now, as concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gouernement of the church of Chriſt by the ſpirit of God working in his children, by the miniſterie of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and reuealed word: and alſo touching the eſſentiall points of the outward policie and gouernement of the church, conſiſting in the true teaching of the word of God, in the due adminiſtration of ſacraments according to Chriſtes holic inſtitution, in the aduancement and furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of vertue, with the beating downe and ſuppreſſing of ſinne and impietie, and in keeping the church in a quiet vnitie and good order; there is no difference or varietie of opinion amongſt vs. Which wholie therefore dooth reſt in this point, touching the forme and manner of putting this externall church gouernement in vre and practiſe. For they affirme, that <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 19, 20, 239.</note> Chriſt hath left, and <hi>Commanded as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a rule and law for the gouernement of the church (his fathers houſhold) by diſcipline, as he hath doone by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> which is ſaie they, by their conſiſtories and preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: and alſo that the ſame is perpetuall, and ought ſo to continue vnto the worlds end, in euerie particular church. Both which we denie, and with all affirme; that no ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and exact forme of externall gouernment of the church by diſcipline, as they depaint out, is ſo much as by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample recommended vnto vs in ſcripture: but much leſſe commanded, as a continuall platforme for euer to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. To their firſt aſſeueration belong thoſe their ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where they call it <hi>The presbyterie which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: the arke of God: the Lords houſe, a royall throne for Chriſt to ſit and rule in.</hi> And where other of <note n="*" place="margin">T.

                        <note n="*" place="margin">Admon. 2. pag. 5.</note> and that <hi>The matters they deale in, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

The antecedent of which Enthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme is ſophiſticall, becauſe of the double and treble ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worde Churches, and therefore the argument lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But they will not haue the name of (Churches) in their Argument to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in this ſenſe.

And therefore, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that liuinges of Churches and Pariſhes are diſtinguiſhed, by man, therefore they maye bee vnited by man, though in ſome ſenſe the ſame may bee true, yet thereby it followeth not, that manie liuinges appointed by the Lorde himſelfe for manie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours ouer manie Congregations, ſhould bee taken from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and bee giuen to one.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:22006:186"/> or for the reteining of two benefices. Naie the contrarie is true &amp; followeth well. The law in ſome caſes dooth permit a diſpenſation for reteining of mo benefices, conſidering a diſpenſation néedeth not, but where the rigor or generalitie of law, is vpon ſome occaſion to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, mitigated, or releaſed. And it can not be called a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation or immunitie, but where the law is or appeareth to be in generall termes otherwiſe to the contrarie. And it is incident to the libertie and fréedome wherein we are borne, that we may without further licence doo that which law dooth not forbid vs: in which reſpect <hi>Priuilegium</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quaſi priuata lex,</hi> a priuat or particular law, touching but a few in compariſon of thoſe that be within the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſpoſition of that lawe, which ſeemeth to be contrarie. And therefore by as good pretext and colour of probabilitie, he might haue reaſoned thus: By common right in this land, a fellon or traitor condemned is to be executed; <hi>Ergo</hi> it is vnlawfull for the prince to pardon him. Or thus: By common right, all wrecks, dedans, fellons and outlawes goods, léets and views of franke pledge doo belong vnto the crowne: <hi>Ergo</hi> the ſpeciall grants of theſe and ſuch like from hir Maieſtie and hir noble progenitors, to ſundrie perſons and corporations in this realme, are vnlawfull, and the patentees can not with a good conſcience enioy them.

So that till our author ſhall take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to prooue, that either the law dooth not permit anie diſpenſations at all for mo benefices than one, vpon anie circumſtance or occaſion whatſoeuer: or elſe that the law ought not and can not grant anie ſuch immunitie or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge: we muſt follow him vp and downe at rouers, ſpeaking to no purpoſe, and in the meane time (as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is) waſh an aſſes head. Therefore let vs brieflie looke
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:22006:187"/> into his proofes, againſt one mans reteining of mo benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and into his apodeſticall ſyllogiſmes, collected vpon them as he imagineth. His firſt allegation <note n="*" place="margin">c. quia non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulli, Ext. de clericis non reſid.</note> taken out of the decretals (though both it and all other ſounding to that purpoſe be to be vnderſtood, as ſhall appeare after, of ſuch perſons onelie as be not qualified as they ought, nor diſpenſed with as they might) dooth yet ſimplie, in it ſelfe conſidered, make nothing againſt the practiſe of our church herein: for it prouideth againſt the couetouſnes of ſuch onelie, as <hi>Being ſcarſe able to diſcharge one office,</hi> doo not onelie ſeeke, being vnqualified and vndiſpenſed with, to <hi>Procure vnto themſelues diuers eccleſiaſticall dignities,</hi> but alſo <hi>Diuers pariſh churches.</hi> So that it might verie well be applied againſt ſuch a man, being priuie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe how vnworthie he is for the enioieng of anie ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie fauor, and therefore out of hope euer to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure diſpenſation: would <hi>De facto,</hi> for the ſatiſfieng of his gréedie gaine, inuade as manie dignities and inferior be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices eccleſiaſticall, as by hooke or crooke he could anie waie come by. For the other <note n="*" place="margin">c. 1. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudine in 6.</note> place here quoted, cleerelie decideth: both that with diſpenſation, a man may reteine lawfullie two perſonages, two dignities, prouoſtſhips, or offices, togither with a prebend (though all thrée belong to one church) ſo the ſame be expreſlie conteined in ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation: and alſo that if the cuſtome of the ſaid church be ſo, he may reteine one perſonage, dignitie, prouoſiſhip, or office eccleſiaſticall togither with a prebend, without diſpenſation. And therefore his ſecond or Minor propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his firſt ſyllogiſme, where he ſimplie aſſumeth, that the enioieng of many benefices, howſoeuer, or by whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, to be a maintenance of couetouſnes, is not true, nor out of this place confirmed. For if it were <hi>Cauſa per ſe, &amp; non per accidens tantùm</hi> of couetouſnes, then ſhould the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of ſo much yéerelie liuing, as ſuch benefices ioined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither amount vnto, be vnlawfull, &amp; condemned as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie roote of couetouſneſſe, in anie man whatſoeuer.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:22006:187"/> And if his firſt propoſition or Maior be vnderſtood of a <note place="margin">Fallacies for reaſons.</note> cauſe or maintenance of couetouſnes <hi>Perſe,</hi> then hath he made a fallacie <hi>Ab. accidente,</hi> to condemne in his Minor, that, as ſimplie mainteining of couetouſneſſe, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by accident and caſualtie falleth out to giue an occaſion for a couetous mind to worke on. But if he meane, that euerie thing is vnlawfull, which accidentallie may occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on couetouſnes, then is his Maior vntrue: for then, gold, ſiluer, poſſeſſions, children, and all ſuch externall goods, whereby (not by any fault in themſelues, but as by an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion) men be diuerſſie drawne into couetouſnes, ſhould be condemned and abandoned as ſimplie vnlawfull. His ſecond ſyllogiſme is a fallacie <hi>Ab eo quod est ſecundum quid vt ſimpliciter.</hi> For his Minor is falſe, if it be vnderſtood of thoſe that be both qualified and diſpenſed with, as law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth: which he ſetteth downe as ſimplie true, bicauſe the canons forbid generallie men not diſpenſed with therevnto, to reteine mo benefices. The like is to be ſaid of the third ſyllogiſme, whoſe Minor being propounded ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie, as though euerie one (though he be diſpenſed with) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſtipend of mo benefices, did take that which is due vnto manie: is vtterlie to be denied. Except he will ſaie, that as the ſaid ſtipends haue beene heeretofore ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto mo: ſo they may be againe, and therefore are due to many. But then, ſéeing he diſputeth not according to the ſame time, his argument is faultie vpon the <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the elench.</hi> And if his Minor of his fourth ſyllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme be vniuerſallie taken, which it muſt needs be, or elſe his concluſion will be particular, and carrie no ſhew to his purpoſe; then is the ſame alſo as vntrue as the former, and to be denied. For I doo not doubt but there be verie many in this church of England (though not ſo manie as were to be wiſhed in reſpect of the pariſhes) which by the mercie of God are as well able in all reſpects, conſidering the frailtie of man, to diſcharge that dutie, which is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to a paſtorall charge; as in any age heeretofore hath

The Maior propoſition of which his laſt ſyllogiſme, except it be ment of a perpetuall and a continuall hinderance, which yet the partie himſelfe might auoid, or of ſuch as otherwiſe dooth not bring ſome greater or as great a benefit to the whole church ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waie, is vtterlie alſo vntrue. For beſides the gréeuous viſitation of God by ſickneſſe, which is no ſufficient cauſe (as hath béene afore ſhewed) to remooue a man from his benefice, who therefore may haue a coadiutor aſſigned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: there may be manie other cauſes laid downe, for the which a man may iuſtlie ſometimes be awaie from his paſtorall charge, and diſcharge it by another: as namelie if he be abroad for recouerie of his health: if he be called by his ſuperiors authoritie to anſwer matter in law obiected againſt him: if he be forced for the repulſing of gréeuous and in tollerable iniuries, to proſecute another in law, or for the reteining of his owne right: if he be ſent of ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by his prince, or otherwiſe neceſſarilie emploied and commanded attendance: if his helpe be required in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places for the pacifieng of ſchiſmes and diſorders, and for confutation of hereſies: if his paines and trauell be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the confirmation of true doctrine, taught by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: if his preſence be deſired as needfull or expedient at ſome conſultation about church matters, as at ſome ſynod particular, prouinciall, nationall, or generall: and laſtlie, if ſome other parts of the ſaid nation and church ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be wholie deſtitute of a paſtor to féed and inſtruct them. For if vpon theſe and manie other like occaſions, of no leſſe importance, it were ſimplie vnlawfull for a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to be abſent ſometimes from his paſtorall cure, and to ſubſtitute another to ſupplie his roome: whie (I praie you) may diuerſe of your <hi>Saints of God, and ſeruants of the</hi>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:22006:189"/> proper goods, and not borrowed out of this canon. The <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and often going to and fro,</hi> which the canon ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of, and he tranſlateth as it liketh him, a <hi>Diſſolute and gadding miniſterie,</hi> whereas yet no mention is made of miniſterie, is (as I take it) ſet downe, to ſhew a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of reteining ſuch within the bounds of eccleſiaſticall rules and offices, which by occaſion of their ſeuerall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bends ſituate in diuerſe churches, are often called to and fro about the affaires incident to their ſeuerall liuings. Yet neither dooth this <hi>Decretall</hi> ſimplie condemne, as a thing intolerable, all ſuch <hi>Going to and fro,</hi> but where it <hi>conteineth perill of ſoules</hi> withall: neither can it be with anie reaſon found fault with, where otherwiſe vpon ſome weightier occaſion, it tendeth to a greater benefit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the church, than this can anie waies be offenſiue: which offenſe, is the onelie ground almoſt, why this often <hi>going to and fro,</hi> can with anie colour be reprehended. And therfore his Maior muſt be better vnderlaid with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, before we may abſolutelie admit of it, as true. The <hi>Medium</hi> or reaſon of his third ſyllogiſme, which he maketh ſeuerall by it ſelfe, is ioined with a copulatiue to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the former ſyllogiſme, and ſo both they ſhould make but one reaſon. Now, to haue diuers benefices, dooth not neceſſarilie conteine (as he aſſumeth indiſtinalie in his Minor thereof) anie perill of ſoules: but onlie then, when the partie is not diſpenſed with to reteine them, as the <note n="*" place="margin">Gl. in c. quia in tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Extr. de prebendis in verbo ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum per text. c. du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum. 2.

The cauſe of which perill of ſoules, ouer and aboue the parties owne danger, bicauſe he can not with a good conſcience reteine vnto himſelfe anie thing againſt law, is aſſigned to be this: that <note n="*" place="margin">Gl. ver. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptae, c. dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> he being not diſpenſed with, and therefore his benefice, though in fact by him reteined, yet by law in deed meerelie void: ail his exerciſe of the keies for binding and looſing of the pariſhioners of his firſt benefice, ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as being done <hi>A non iudice,</hi> become void alſo, and ſo
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:22006:190"/> thoſe ſhall forſooth dangerouſlie remaine in their ſinnes, which thought they had béene by him in ſhrift cleerelie ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued. Which reaſon being by the light of Gods goſpell diſcouered to be but vaine, that which is built therevpon muſt needs topple downe to the ground withall. For we know that no <note n="*" place="margin">c. ſi quis &amp;c. cum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis. 24. q. 3.</note> ſentence of anie mortall man can either bind or loaſe a mans ſins, otherwiſe than the word of God dooth warrant and declare: according to which if it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by whomſoeuer, the ſentence is good, and ratified by God himſelfe, as he hath promiſed. In which reſpect al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome canons, and ſome of the ſounder ſchoolemen haue taught, that the ſentence of the prieſt dooth onelie bind declaratiuelie, and not diſpoſitiuelie. The Maior propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his laſt ſyllogiſme here, doth by no coherence of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hang togither: for both in the church and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth manie occaſions may be aſſigned, that doo in ſome ſort indirectlie <hi>Hinder other from doing fruitfull ſeruice in either of them,</hi> which yet may and ought to be tolerated. For what if ſome notable man by due deſert haue attei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuerſe high offices, which by reaſon of the manie old reuerend yeares wherewith God dooth bleſſe him farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expectation, in which time neuertheleſſe manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent men perhaps are bred vp, by all likelihood able in verie good ſort to ſerue in thoſe ſeuerall roomes of the church or common-wealth which he enioieth: ſhall ſuch a man in this regard be ſtripped foorth of moſt of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings, leaſt others ſhould want in the meane time, and be hindered from imploiment according to their ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie? Or ſhall we therefore accuſe old-age, and the bleſſing of manie yeares as a thing intolerable? So that we ſee it is a <hi>Fallacie ab accidente,</hi> like diuers of the reſt which are branded with the ſame ſtampe. The Minor alſo of the ſaid ſyllogiſme hath as ſlender color of truth as the former. For as one of the ends (as I conceiue of the ſtatute) was to haue ſuch as were intended to be of greater gifts, to haue larger rewards: ſo was it another end, rather to haue two
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:22006:190"/> diuerſe pariſhes allotted to one man able to inſtruct them, and they to mainteine him: than to haue them ſerued by two ſeuerall men not ſufficient to inſtruct either of them. So that it may trulie be verified, verie few ſufficient preachers, by this onelie meanes of one mans inioieng two benefices, to want maintenance, or to be hindered from dooing ſeruice in the church: which may appeare by taking an eſtimate in euerie countrie of ſuch liuings, which be of as ſufficient liueliehood as the moſt ſeuerall liuings of anie pluraliſts, which are not yet beſtowed ſo well as were to be wiſhed.</p>

Likewiſe, though three witneſſes at the ciuill law doo directlie depoſe concerning a mans teſtament, yet if no more were preſent, the teſtament ſhall be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and that with good conſcience, where that law hath place: which requireth the ſeales of the teſtator, and of ſeauen witneſſes. The like may be ſaid of our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, which deſcend onelie to the eldeſt in bloud, though the aforeſaid reaſon of <hi>S.

Concerning the other part of his Minor propoſition, that <hi>None can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or diſpenſe with the law of nature,</hi> bicauſe <hi>all naturall things are immutable:</hi> I ſaie firſt, that by this vntrue tranſlation of <hi>All naturall things,</hi> in ſteed of <hi>All lawes of nature,</hi> he hath diſaduantaged greatlie his owne cauſe. For it is verie notorious, that not onelie all naturall things, euen the heauens themſelues which doo were old as
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:22006:198"/> dooth a garment, are ſubiect to mutabilitie; but euen par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular nature, or (as the old ſchoolemen terme it) <hi>Natura naturata</hi> is inuerted and changed by manie caſualites, as in production of monſters: and the naturall inclinations of manie are brideled, and almoſt wholie ſubdued by good education, ioined with the grace of God. Euen the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then philoſopher <hi>Socrates</hi> confeſſed that he was by nature blockiſh and lecherous, as the <hi>Phyſiognomer</hi> had coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which yet he had altered by <hi>Philoſophie.</hi> But it is alſo requiſite that we ſhould, vpon particular diſcourſe of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie lawes of nature, conſider how well the Abſtractor dooth vnderſtand this law, which he bringeth, to prooue the vnchangeableneſſe of the law of nature. By the verie firſt law of nature, no man did ſeeke any further than to lead a priuate life, thinking it ſufficient to prouide onelie for himſelfe, his wife and his children, without anie care or thought taking, for anie publike or common-weale.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:22006:198"/> of all that is otherwiſe moſt deare vnto vs: we haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience by the dailie examples of valiant reſolute men, and of good ſubiects in all ages. Which kind of prodigalitie, and profuſion (if I may ſo terme it) of our owne bloud, and incolumitie in regard of the publike-weale of our countrie, is greatlie differing from that inſtict, whereby euerie man is naturallie lead by all meanes poſſible, to preſerue himſelfe from all bodilie dangers. Likewiſe the naturall bond and coniunction of man and <note n="*" place="margin">L. 1. §. ius na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turale ff. de iuſtitia.</note> woman by matrimonie, as <hi>Vlpian</hi> dooth terme it, hath beene ſubiect to changes, euen by the <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 19.</note> appointment of the diuine law-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Moſes:</hi> yea, and moreouer vpon the neceſſitie of the circumſtances therein conſiderable (leaſt that vnkind peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould miſerablie torment their wiues which they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) is not condemned ſimplie in <hi>Moſes</hi> by our ſauiour Chriſt. But if we will affirme, as humane writers doo teach, that the firſt and ſimpleſt times of nature had no certeine mariages, nor knew no children in certeintie, till people had drawne themſelues into common ſocieties one with another; and with <hi>Caſtrenſis,</hi> that the coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man and woman is of the law of nature, the bond of matrimonie with one certeine woman of the law of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the ſolemnities about mariage to be of the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue law of euerie ſeuerall commonweale: then is the law of nature herein greatlie (though iuſtlie) changed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the prohibitions of marriage in certeine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées of affinitie and conſanguinitie firſt ſet <note n="*" place="margin">Leuit. 18.</note> downe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of God, and afterward by the light of reaſon, amongſt moſt nations (though heathen) intertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Yea, if matrimonie be of the law of nature, then is the naturall libertie thereof verie much abridged, by ſuch <note n="*" place="margin">Inſtit. de nuptiji. § 1.</note> wholeſome ciuill lawes, which make it otherwiſe no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in thoſe, who are vnder their fathers tuition, except their expreſſe aſſent be firſt obteined therevnto. <note n="*" place="margin">Tull. li. 2. de natura deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. l. libero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum. 220. §. vlt. de ver. ſignific.</note> Another branch of the law of nature, is that care of perpetuitie which is ingraffed in man: which bicauſe it cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined

And yet it is not vnlawfull, no not in termes of diuinitie, for <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 19. 1. Cor. 7.</note> a man that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine, to lead a ſole and a ſingle life. And that this is a kind of naturall expectation in parents, as it were to were yoong and to liue againe in their children, it may hereby be gathered; bicauſe <note n="b" place="margin">L. iſti qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem §. vlt. ff. quod metus cauſa.</note> diuers do much leſſe eſtéeme their owne life, than the life of their children. And euen as by the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of philoſophers, and deciſion of lawyers it is found, that the <note n="c" place="margin">Plutarc. in Theſeo.</note> ſhip wherein <hi>Theſeus</hi> was carried into <hi>Candie</hi> to ſubdue the monſtrous <hi>Minotaure,</hi> being for a memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of that act, ſo long kept by the <hi>Atheniens,</hi> that by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall repairing of it, no one planke or péece of timber was left, which it had in the time of <hi>Theſeus;</hi> yet was <note n="d" place="margin">L. propone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur ff. de iudicijs.</note> to be accompted the ſame ſhip: and as we are to be accompted the ſame people which we were two hundred yeares ago, though no one of that age doo now remaine: euen ſo by the continuall ſucceſſion of our iſſue one after another, we ſéeme to be often borne againe, and thereby to enioy a kind of immortalitie. The next bud of the law of nature, is the defenſe &amp; education of our children, both bicauſe of their weakeneſſe, which is ſuch, that if we ſhould but denie our helpe to anie other (though far more ſtrange vnto vs than they are) being in like caſe, we ſhould breake that <note n="e" place="margin">Tull. li. 3. offic.</note> law of nature, which commandeth man to doo good to man, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in that reſpect that he is a man: and alſo bicauſe they are a part of our ſelues, to the propugnation and bringing vp of whome, we are taught by the liuelie examples euen of ſundrie dumbe creatures. <note n="f" place="margin">Li. 3. ca. 22.</note>

Alſo that law of nature concerning the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of children in the goods and lands of their parents, being reckoned by <hi>Gratian,</hi> and reported to be a law of nature in ſundrie places of the ciuill lawes, is no leſſe than the reſt encountred, changed, and abridged vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe occaſions by good and neceſſarie poſitiue lawes of ſeuerall nations. By the <note n="*" place="margin">L. verbis le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis. 120. ff. de ver. ſignifi.</note> law of the <hi>Twelue rables</hi> (which continued for manie yeares togither) the fathers (without any cauſe) might diſinherit their children. In England it is prouided, that the inheritance onelie ſhall diſcend vnto the eloeſt ſonne; and yet may the father alſo by ſundrie meanes cut off all his children and kindred from the inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng of his lands and goods, if he be ſo hardlie diſpoſed. Yea both by the ciuill law and common law, if the father doo commit treaſon, his children are deueſted of his lands, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:22006:200"/> by the one of them made vncapable alſo, to take anie lands by diſcent from another. Another lawe of nature, which is reckoned by <hi>Gratian,</hi> is, the common dominion of all goods and lands, without anie diſtinction of proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to this or that man: by reaſon that the fruits of the earth in that ſearſitie of men in the beginning was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and more than ſufficient for euerie one. But <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſeemeth to miſname the matter ſomething, where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the poſſeſſion of things then to haue beene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Which as as it could not poſſibly be, ſo is it certeine that none without iniurie and breach of the lawe of nature, might inuade the poſſeſſion of that, which another had firſt taken vp for his owne vſe, ſo long as he would ſo imploie it. Except we will with <hi>Caſtrenſis</hi> extend this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munitie onelie to vnmooueables, as land; and not to mooueables: bicauſe ſuch did fall to his ſhare onelie, which firſt did occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie them, as he is of opinion. Yet not long after, and euer ſince, as well vpon further increaſe of people in the world, as for the auoiding of contention, and for ſome puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch as otherwiſe by violence would haue liued idclie vpon other mens labours: it was thought meet by generall good liking of all nations, to bound out the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of euerie man in ſeuerall proprietie: which courſe, all the ciuill nations in the world at this daie doo inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie and lawfullie practiſe, notwithſtanding the firſt law of nature were to the contrarie. The next lawe of nature to theſe, is, <note n="*" place="margin">L. manumiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones. ff. de iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitia.</note> that libertie and freedome, wherein we are all borne, and whereby a man may do what he liſt, ſo long as he offendeth not. In which <note n="*" place="margin">Iuſtit. de iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re naturali §. ius autens gentium.</note> reſpect the law ſaith, that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſeruitude is contrarie to the right and lawe of nature. Neuertheleſſe it is verie notorious, how from time to time it hath beene vſuall, to keepe ſuch in bondage for their puniſhment, who either themſelues, or whoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had béene taken in warre, and ſaued from death, the danger whereof they had incurred: and it is yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all nations (ſauing in <hi>France)</hi> yea euen in manie
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:22006:201"/> places of England lawfullie reteined, without any diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement herein from good chriſtianitie. Yea it is ſo farre off from iniuſtice to reſtraine and abridge that vnconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned libertie, which the liberalitie of this law of nature had endowed vs withall, that it was more than neceſſarie to bridle and bound it within the liſts of good and neceſſarie lawes and ordinances, as we ſee it is vſed at this daie in all well gouerned common-wealths. Another of thoſe, which <hi>Gratian</hi> in the place before alledged reporteth to be of the law of nature, is this, that the proprietie and free vſe of thoſe things which liue in the aire, the land or ſea, ought to be in him which ſhall happen to take them. Yet now we <note n="*" place="margin">14. Hen. 8. 1.

                     <p>Hauing thus ſhewed (beſides the abſurd forme of that <hi>ſyllogiſme,</hi> which is gathered vpon his diſcourſe in this <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and conſiſting all of <hi>Nagatiues)</hi> the wants alſo and vntruths of both the propoſitions therof <hi>Ex ſuper abundanti;</hi> I will now more brieflie examine the two other <hi>ſyllogiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> which he hath annexed therevnto.

The Minor thereof is alſo vntrue, and to be examined in particular, when he commeth to the proofe of it. Alſo, <hi>That euerie law grounded vpon the reaſon of nature, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of the law of God is immutable,</hi> being his Maior of his ſecond <hi>ſyllogiſme,</hi> he would prooue by that which hath beene examined afore; to wit, <hi>That all naturall things are immutable.</hi> Which neither is of it ſelfe abſolutelic true, but with that vnderſtanding which I haue ſhewed; neither dooth the other follow of it, if this were ſimplie to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by any coherence of reaſon. For the ground-worke, and that which giueth ſtrength to a thing, may be ſure and vnchangeable, when as yet that which is built therevpon may be vnſure and ſubiect to mufabilities. Elſe we muſt needs eſtabliſh a perpetuitie in all good lawes of man without any alteration, vpon what occaſion ſoeuer, ſeeing they all (though many waies diuerſe among themſelues) doo take their foundation and reaſon from the immutable equitie of the law of God.

For as ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie and different <hi>Poſitiue lawes</hi> may be drawne from one principle of the law of nature, or of the law of nations, (called <hi>The ſecondarie law of nature)</hi> according to the leſſe or greater proportion and meaſure of the influence of it into them, and yet all of them tolerable, and to be obeied by thoſe, vnto whom reſpectiuelie they doo apperteine: ſo, much more (no doubt) may repugnant <hi>Poſitiue lawes</hi> be grounded and eſtabliſhed vpon ſeuerall <hi>Principles and Maximes</hi> of the law of nature. As may be ſeene by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her it ance vpon diſcent after the order of <hi>Common law</hi> to the eldeſt, by <hi>Borough-engliſh</hi> to the yoongeſt, and by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel-kind</hi> to all ſonnes alike. Likewiſe by the loſſe of lands in the ſonne for the fathers treaſon, by the courſe of the <hi>Common lawe,</hi> though the lands holden in <hi>Gauel-kind</hi> cannot be ſo forfeited. None of which lawes (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie one to another) but they haue both good and ſound reaſons, drawne from the lawe of God and of nature, wherevpon they are ſetled: and alſo may both lawfullie be reteined, and vpon iuſt occaſion in like maner be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or reuerſed. Out of the <hi>Ciuill law</hi> this may ſerue for an example hereof, that although by reaſon it may ſéeme, that any thing is fullie prooued by two or thrée witneſſes aboue all exceptions: yet vpon another reaſon, which is for the auoiding of all corrupt dealing in <hi>Teſtaments,</hi> being the laſt wiſh of the <hi>Teſtator,</hi> (and therefore moſt carefullie to be prouided for) it is by that law decided, that no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <hi>Teſtament</hi> ſhall be effectuall, which is not ſigned with the <hi>Teſtators,</hi> and with ſeauen, or in ſome caſes, at the leaſt with fiue witneſſes hands and ſeales. The reaſon of taking oths in iudgement is drawne from an ill cauſe, euen that corruption of nature wherevnto we are inclined (without ſome ſtrict bond to the contrarie) to deliuer vntruthes, and to ſupplant our neighbours. Yet the oth is a part of the ſeruice of God, and neceſſarilie in all iudgements retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:22006:205"/> for deciding of controuerſies betwixt man and man. The reaſon and principall ground of forbidding women to procure and ſollicite their freends cauſes being abſent, in iudgement, was the vnſhamefaſt importunitie of one <hi>Calphurnia:</hi> yet we may not hereof gather, that all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which are likewiſe forbidden and debarred from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing as attorneis for other, to be of like diſpoſition vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hir.</p>
                     <p>And if lawes, grounded vpon reaſons and principles of the law of nature and of nations, were thereby (as the <hi>Abſtractor</hi> here gathereth) to be accompted of the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with the verie primarie lawes of nature and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themſelues: then could it not fall out, that there might be diuerſe principles and reaſons of lawes about one matter, tending to contrarie ends: which yet happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth three maner of waies. Firſt, when of diuerſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and reaſons ſome one, amongſt the reſt, notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſlie beareth the ſwaie. Therefore, though the fréedome of man from bondage and thraldome of ſlauerie, be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie waies fauoured in all good lawes, as moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto the lawe of nature, whereby we all are frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne: yet for auoiding of iniuſtice and iniurie among men, it is prouided, that a debtor maie not infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſe and manumit his villaines, if thereby his creditors ſhall not find <hi>Aſſetz</hi> for their ſatiſfaction. And the like to this is obſerued, when as manie or more weightie reaſons do ſwaie one waie, againſt fewer or meaner reaſons of the other ſide. Secondarilie, this happeneth, when as one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and principle is ſo counterpeiſed with another to the contrarie, that it cannot well be decided, whether of them ought to be of more moment. As when it was doubted, whether in fauour of libertie it were better to permit a yoong man, alreadie come to his owne guiding, to manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his bondmen; or elſe to bind him from it, till he ſhould atteine the ſetled ripeneſſe of xxv. yeares of age, required to other his alienations. It was by <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> prouided,

                        <hi>Feriendo medium,</hi> bicauſe of inconuentences that appeared on both ſides, that he might manumit them at the going into the xviij. yeare of his age. And this equalitie &amp; indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie of principles differing as it were euenlie among themſelues, is that which bréedeth ſuch great diuerſitie of iudgements, and ſo manie controuerſed opinions in law both <hi>In ſchooles and conſiſtories;</hi> when men in ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and waieng of them are diſtracted into diuerſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereabouts. Whereof rightlie to determine, is in truth the cheefeſt point of maturitie and diſcretion that may be wiſhed, or can be had in a notable iudge. And yet herein it offentimes commeth to paſſe, that in reſpect of right and iuſtice, it is not greatlie materiall, whether the one reaſon or the other be allowed; bicauſe in regard of ſundrie circumſtances, reaſons, and motions of a mans mind, the ſelfe-ſame thing may be diuerſe waies, if not well determined of, yet at the leaſt not vniuſtlie: which bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vnſkilfull men doo not vnderſtand, thinking that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euerie externall tranſmutation of anie matter, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward propertie thereof is changed, and haue not learned to conceiue, that as in the ſea it is not requiſite, nor ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth greatlie to haue all men ſaile iuſt in one line, which go for one hauen or port: they doo therefore make great ſtirre about nothing, as ſome huge volumes of law (for want of conſideration hereof vainelie written) may teſtifie.

But if there be ſuch a tax, what may be ſaid then of ſuch, as albeit they haue two benefices, are yet far vnder a mediocritie: and which if they might haue ſix mo, of ſuch liuings as they haue, ſhould not yet reach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the value of ſome one benefice? Shall we ſaie, he which hath but one ſuch great one, is free from this danger; and he which hath two, though neuer ſo little ones, ſhall be caught with ambition for aſpiring to ſuch an high honor, and be touched with couetouſnes by the great temptation of ſuch notable reuenues, as peraduenture will not make his pot ſéeth twiſe in a weeke? Naie if theſe ſins muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie take hold of him, that hath euen two of the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in England, by reaſon of the quantitie of the reuenue of them: and if the reſt of his reaſons be alſo in this point good and effectuall, then ſhall the like ſtint of liuing, in all men, as well laie as eccleſiaſticall, be ſimplie condemned, as being againſt the law of God and of nature, for feare of neceſſarie ſtaining of them with ambition, couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, theft, murder, diſſoluteneſſe, &amp; breach of order. But if the quantitie of ground, or number of the pariſhioners to be inſtructed be the efficient or formall cauſe of producing neceſſarilie ſuch foule effects: then ſhould he likewiſe haue caſt out his modell of ground, and proportion of euerie flocke, which may not be exceeded: and ſhould haue ſhewed vs, how farre the large pariſhes which we haue in ſundrie places, ought to be ſhred off, lopped, pared, and therby redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the <hi>Comelines and decencie</hi> which he fanſieth. And alſo how this deuiſe may ſtand with theirs and his owne platforme, which would haue diuerſe pariſhes vnited into one. And likewiſe, why one may not haue two pariſhes by the name of two, as ſome (by law therevnto allowed) haue at this time: as well as by the new guiſe and deuiſe,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:22006:208"/> to allow the ſame man three or foure pariſhes in déed, but vnited together and called but one. For the Abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor maketh no difference in this treatiſe, whether the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices doo ioine together, or be diſioined by anie diſtance, for he indefinitlie dooth condemne the hauing of mo bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices than one, howſoeuer they be ſituat. And herevpon it would follow that it is more méet, that all the pariſhioners (though in the foule and ſhort daies of winter, how old and craſie ſoeuer they be) of thrée or foure pariſhes, as they be now diſtinguiſhed, ſhould take the paines to aſſemble themſolues into one place to heare their miniſter, rather than he ſhould come vnto them, and teach them at home in their pariſh churches, as they now doo lie in ſeueraltie. But if the diuiding of his auditorie, and teaching them at ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times, be the verie efficient or formall cauſe of this heape of enormities, and the onelie thing which miſliketh him: then truelie (beſides that it can not be proued or yet imagined, how the diuiſion of a mans auditorie ſhould make the miniſter guiltie of ſuch crimes) he muſt alſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe condemne thoſe which doo teach and inſtruct ſeuerall families at home and apart, from the reſt of the bodie of that congregation. Alſo we muſt hereby diſallow all chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels of eaſe wherſoeuer, ſome of which (as I haue crediblie heard) are in ſome places 6. 7. or eight miles diſtant from their pariſh church. And by the like reaſon, if all diuiding of a mans auditorie be ſo vnlawfull, it will follow that the miniſter is much to be blamed, which teacheth not all his pariſh at one time, though in deed neceſſarie occaſions of buſineſſe falling out doo draw ſometimes one, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another into other places abroad, and doo deteine thoſe which be ſeruants verie often at home, whereby it is not poſſible to teach them all at once. And therefore we may conclude ſafelie, that the hauing of mo benefices dooth not formallie or efficientlie infer anie of thoſe faults which the Abſtractor, by the miſvnderſtanding of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non law, would needs inforce: and that therevpon the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent</hi>

For with as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he might inforce an equalitie of liuings in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men, as in eccleſiaſticall: conſidering both the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the ſubiect and matter, whereabout the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall are conuerſant, and alſo as great inequalitie of one aboue another, and difference of learning, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods good gifts to be ſhewed in the gouerning and inſtructing of the people in matter of religion, as may be found by any poſſibilitie in the dexteritie of one man more than of another in managing by counſell, or defending by proweſſe the ciuill affaires and frontiers of a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Which thing, the ſlender ſparkes of the light of nature remaining, did teach euen vnto the Gentiles: who
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:22006:217"/> were content to aduance their religious perſons amongſt them vnto ſingular honor, to reſpect them with large and bountifull maintenance, and to haue their heſts and aduiſe in notable recommendation. The Minor of his owne ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme being the verie contradictorie of the Minor afore propounded by waie of obiection, he ſeeketh yet better to vnderprop (as he had need) not againſt ſuch onelie, as are <hi>Diſpoſed to cauill,</hi> but thoſe alſo that muſt denie as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, both his Minor, the Antecedent, and alſo Conſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby he would prooue it. For he would prooue <hi>Churches to be eſtabliſhed and diſtinguiſhed by the Lord himſelfe,</hi> bicauſe <hi>Though the limits of pariſhes be borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by man, and that a certeine number of people, called to make one congregation, and to heare at one time, in one place, one certeine paſtor, be at the rule and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man: yet that theſe things ſhould be thus done, is the ſpeciall commandement of the Lord.</hi> As if he ſhould ſaie, Though it be ſo, yet it is not ſo. For how dooth this follow? God hath commanded <hi>Churches to be eſtabliſhed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, Ergo he did eſtabliſh and diſtinguiſh them:</hi> more than theſe like reaſons? God commanded there ſhould be places comelie and decent for holie aſſemblies, <hi>Ergo</hi> he himſelfe built all our faire churches. Or, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded euerie man to get his liuing by the ſweat of his owne browes, <hi>Ergo</hi> God getteth euerie mans liuing by the ſweat of his owne browes.

But if this be the onelie fault, then let him call both the flocks but one, as to this intent and purpoſe: yet none can be ignorant, how ſlender reaſons ſuch alluſions be, and what inſinite abſurdities would follow, if we ſhould vrge a conformitie in all points betwixt a naturall and a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike bodie.

Now, in that other member of <hi>Diſpenſations of iuſtice,</hi> more properlie ſo called, which are beſtowed about the poſitiue lawes of man, we haue to obſerue two ſeuerall varieties. One is, when the generall force and obligation of the law remaining, yet the reaſon thereof in ſome particular caſe dooth ceaſe, which may and ought to be by the ſouereigne prince or other inferiour iudge ſo declared. Another is, when as the law is grounded vpon diuerſe reaſons. For then, though one or two of ſuch reaſons doo ceaſe, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thoſe reaſons thereof, which doo remaine, the law ſhall ſtill reteine his force. Nay, though the poſitiue law of man be enuious, as <note n="b" place="margin">L. vnica.

Howveit I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared alreadie, that whereſoeuer the generall law dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, though in ſome particular caſe it doo ceaſe: that there (as in the other caſes here alledged) this <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is needfull, and ought not in right to be denied; for the which cauſe it is alſo called, <hi>A diſpenſation of iuſtice.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, there is a third kind of diſpenſation mixt of both: as taking ſome part of that which is called <hi>Of grace,</hi> bicauſe he that hath authoritie to diſpenſe hereby, is not in waie of iuſtice preciſelie compellable to grant it: and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing other ſome part of that, which is called <hi>Of iuſtice,</hi> bicauſe this ought not to be granted ſimplie, but vpon iuſt cauſe: by reaſon that the poſitiue lawes of man, about which onelie this diſpenſation is conuerſant by common intendement, are enacted for ſome publike vtilitie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit. So that without good ground, a man ought not to be exempted from the generall charge of the common-welth, which other are to ſuffeine: ſpeciallie when ſuch his exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be burdenſome to others. This laſt ſort of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations may be defined to be <hi>A releaſe in ſome eſpeciall caſe and certeine perſons of the generall bond, and reaſon of a poſitiue law, by him that hath authoritie therevnto.</hi> And this authoritie muſt either be committed expreſlie, or is couertlie implied to be attributed vnto a ſouereigne prince: either by the operation of the law, as when <note n="*" place="margin">L. d.

                     <p>And this ſame preſumed intention of the meaning of the lawemakers, is the moſt proper cauſe that (in my iudgement) can be aſſigned generallie of euerie diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of this qualitie and condition.

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:22006:225"/> The Minor of his firſt ſyllogiſme of the three, being vnture and to be denied, wherein he aſſumeth the <hi>Hauing of manie benefices, or non reſidencie, to be repugnant to the lawes of God,</hi> though he haue not named non reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie afore, he telleth vs (if we may beléeue him) that he hath alreadie prooued <hi>By infallible concluſions of law, and vndoubted truthes of the word of God.</hi> Yet his lawes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged doo not once mention repugnancie with the word and ſcripture. <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Pag. </seg>121</label> And out of ſcripture to this purpoſe he hath alledged none but one place out of the firſt to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> that miniſters ought to haue maintenance. But he inforceth this matter by this argument, as I doo gather it: Whatſoeuer cauſe or matter is repugnant to the word of God, is by ſtatute vndiſpenſable: The cauſe or matter of hauing manie benefices, is repugnant to the word of God; namelie, ambition, pride, couetouſnes, perill of ſoules, &amp;c: Therefore the cauſe or matter of hauing manie benefices, is by ſtatute vndiſpenſable. Firſt, to ſpeake to the matter hereof, the Minor is vntrue, bicauſe the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent maintenance of the miniſter, and the enioieng of a preacher rather than none, are the immediate impulſiue cauſes of permiſſion to enioy mo benefices. But if plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie ſhould be an efficient cauſe of ambition, pride, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, perill of ſoules, &amp;c: which it cannot be (otherwiſe than <hi>Per accidens</hi> by indirect occaſion) then are theſe vices effects of it, and not they cauſes thereof, as here is auow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. But if we ſhould admit theſe crimes to be <hi>cauſes</hi> of hauing mo benefices, then would I grant his concluſion, that the Archbiſhop may not diſpenſe with thoſe enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: whereof neuertheleſſe will not follow, but that he might (this notwithſtanding) diſpenſe with hauing of mo benefices, being but the effect as he ſuppoſeth.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:22006:226"/> word: but in the Minor of this argument, it is taken by relation to the effect of that matter, which is to be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with for the verie reaſon of the prohibition it ſelfe. In his ſecond ſyllogiſme, I haue ſhewed afore out of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, that the <hi>Maior</hi> is by him fained. For neither is any mention made of <hi>Peace or conſeruation,</hi> neither is <hi>The wealth and profit of the realme</hi> ſpoken of there in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations abſolutelie, but in caſes vnwoont, and vnto the perſon of the prince. And yet his Minor propoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is alſo vnſufficientlie vpholden. For the enioieng of two benefices, is as far off from making vp ſuch follie and wealthie prelats, as they doo ſeeme onelie vnto the left en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious eie of this <hi>Detractor;</hi> as this aſſertion is from the truth, that <hi>Hereby ſtipendarie curats and poore miniſters are kept in beggerie.</hi> For it may be their allowance is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of their ſufficiencie, and it is verie ſmall indeed, if it be not more than he himſelfe thinketh them worthie of, who holdeth moſt of ſuch curats for no miniſters at all neither in fact nor lawe. But if it were granted, that ſome ſuch as are too meanlie prouided for, might be placed in ſome ſeuerall benefices that are enioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by another: dooth he thinke that the releeuing of him hereby, will eaſe the common-wealth, or profit the church, as much as the abridging of ſufficient maintenance will decaie both the number and abilities of our beſt grounded and moſt learned diuines, who are onelie fit to impugne the errours and hereſies of poperie and of other ſects? His ſecond reaſon of proportion drawne from diuerſe other myſteries and trades forbidden to be exerciſed by one rich and mightie man, to the intent to prooue that a damage groweth to the common-wealth, by one mans enioieng of two poore benefices, which can be accounted indeed but one trade: if it be a ſound reaſon of iuſtice and equitie, as it is pretended, it will not onelie inferre, that a ſeuerall gift and facultie of learning is required for euerie ſeuerall congregation, as the cunning in ſeuerall trades is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:22006:226"/> but alſo muſt inforce an vnlawfulneſſe in all ſorts of men to inioy ſeuerall lordſhips, or any inequalitie of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and ſubſtance whatſoeuer: bicauſe manie of <hi>The poorer ſort might liue of ſuch poſſeſſions in one mans hand, well and honeſtlie in the common-wealth:</hi> which is a bitter roote of the wéed of Anabaptiſticall equalitie and communitie. The laſt reaſon, which he bringeth for proofe of his ſecond Minor, is taken from the conueniencie of fulfilling the deads wils and teſtaments: as though all foundations and dotations of churches, had béene by laſt wils and teſtaments onelie eſtabliſhed, and as though they had eſpeciallie regarded by their ſaid wils the ſeruing of thoſe churches by paſtors continuallie reſiant, and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing anie liuing elſewhere. But (I praie you) how was it lawfull for the latter men to alter the wils of the former founders, by making new diſtinctions of pariſhes and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotments of liuings, if other pariſhes and liuings were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed before (as he abſurdlie ſeemeth to fanſie) euen by God himſelfe? And why ſhould he be ſo carefull for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of their wils, who for the moſt part in time of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in regard onelie of maſſing for their ſoules, rather than for teaching of the people, and vpon opinion of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heauen thereby, did erect and endow churches; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with ſome little glebe, though the chiefeſt benefit doo ariſe by tythes? Seeing he is of opinion that a matter grounded vpon anie cauſe or reaſon, is of like nature and <note place="margin">His reaſon retorted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe.</note> condition, with the reaſon it ſelfe: ſo that if the cauſe and reaſon, wherevpon they grounded their building and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of churches be impious; then euen the things themſelues ſhall be ſtained with like impietie, and not woorthie thus to be tendered by him. But this his ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall is in deed a verie weake and ſlender coniecture, not worth the name of a preſumption, and meerelie conſiſting in fact without proofe. And it might be better gathered, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pluralities within theſe laſt ſix hundred yéeres (in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of which time moſt churches haue béene built) were
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:22006:227"/> verie rife, as may appeare by lawes eſpecifieng multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of benefices incroched, and reteined without all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence or toleration: that patrones of churches could not be ignorant thereof, and therefore meant to prouide for no ſuch matter, which otherwiſe they would haue expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and met with either in dotation, compoſition, or by teſtament. And hee might with more colour vſe this reaſon, euen againſt the iuſt diſſolution of religious houſes, being directlie and expreſlie contrarie to the mind of the founders: yet with no better authoritie warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than diſpenſations for pluralities, both of them euen by act of parlement. And therefore as the three ſeuerall Minor <hi>propoſitions</hi> of theſe his laſt ſyllogiſmes, built vpon theſe vnſure and feeble grounds, for the proofe of the Minor in his ſecond ſyllogiſme afore, are to be denied: ſo are the verie Maior <hi>propoſitions</hi> all thrée, brought as grounds to build the other vpon, as weake themſelues, as theſe which ſhould be vnderpropped by them. For the great riches of ſome few, is no ſmall occaſion why ſome other doo want, which might haue more plentie, if all the wealth of the richeſt in the land, were diſtributed abroad in the world, and yet are they neceſſarie for the profit and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the common-weale, which conſiſteth by inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as the wiſe doo know, which may ſerue alſo for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of his ſecond Maior: although he which by eſpeciall priuilege hath ſome two liuings aſſigned vnto him, can not properlie be ſaid to enioy manie mens liuings, or any more than that which is his owne by law. The like is to be affirmed of the diſpoſitions in laſt wils and teſtaments, as though whatſoeuer did preiudice them, being made to lawfull and holie vſes, could not be accompted neceſſarie to the welth and profit of the realme. For if a man would deuiſe and bequeath (to neuer ſo lawfull and holie vſes) his lands holden <hi>In capite, in chiualrie,</hi> or entailed, or another mans lands or goods, which courſe is allowed of by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill law: yet is it thought neceſſarie in law, for the wealth
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:22006:227"/> and profit of this land, that in ſome part the one, and that the other ſhould wholie be encountered. So dooth the ciuill lawe diſannull and reuerſe a teſtament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued neuer ſo ſolemnelie, or to how good and godlie vſes ſoeuer; if the teſtators ſonne be omitted, or be without iuſt cauſe diſinherited in it; or if a ſome be borne within ten moneths after his death, of the bodie of his wife. Thus hauing, as ſhortlie as I could, run ouer his reaſoning, it reſteth to ſhew that by the ſtatute law of this land, (which is the iudgement of the whole church &amp; common-weale re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatiuelie) diſpenſations for pluralities are lawfull. Firſt the <note n="*" place="margin">21. <hi>H 8. ca.</hi> 13.</note> ſtatute 21. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. ſaith, that men ſo qualified, (as is there preſcribed) may take and receiue two benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with cure of ſoule by diſpenſation, and therfore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be vnlawfull. But if it be anſwered (as the Abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor goeth about to doo) that all <note n="*" place="margin">25. <hi>H. 8. ca.</hi> 21.</note> diſpenſations are by a later ſtatute reſtrained, ſauing ſuch as be not contrarie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the ſcriptures; intending withall this kind of diſpenſation to be vngodlie, and againſt the word of God: this may be refelled eaſilie by the preamble of the ſaid lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtatute, where it is affirmed <hi>To ſtand with naturall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and good reaſon, in all and euerie lawes humane, made within this realme, or induced by cuſtome, that the parlement ſhould haue authoritie not onlie to diſpenſe, but alſo to authorize ſome elect perſon or perſons to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with thoſe &amp; all other humane lawes of this realme, and with euerie one of them, as the qualities of the perſons and matter ſhall require.</hi>

Or might it not be, that diſpenſations were accuſtomablie granted by him, though he were not head of the church? Or might it not be that diſpenſations were accuſtomablie granted by him, though he were not a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full magiſtrate or diſpenſer? Or may not the Archbiſhop by lawfull authoritie committed vnto him, diſpenſe in ſuch humane lawes as hath beene accuſtomed, though the pope were an vſurper herein? Or laſtlie, if all theſe were admitted, dooth it here vpon follow, that there is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and abſurditie in the ſtatute? Aſſuredlie he had néed to be a kind and tender-harted man, that will yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be ouercome with ſuch reaſons. His ſecond reaſon for proofe of the contrarietie, is to this effect: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for vſurie, periurie, inceſt, adulterie, &amp;c: were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomablie granted at the Sée of Rome: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for ſuch crimes are againſt the word of God: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Therfore ſuch diſpenſations as were accuſtomablie granted at the Sée of Rome, were contrarie to the word of God. Which
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:22006:229"/> is a verie childiſh <hi>Ignorance of the elench,</hi> concluding of meere particulars, and therfore neither in mood nor figure of argument. For although ſome were ſuch that were there granted, yet it dooth not follow that all diſpenſations from thence were of like nature: but the Archbiſhop by authoritie of that ſtatute may diſpenſe with none but ſuch as be not againſt the word of God. But here the Abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor hath ioined with ſuch as vndoubtedlie are againſt the word of God, <hi>Non reſidencie, <hi>and manie benefices.</hi>
                        </hi> The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof is the matter in controuerſie, whereby this is <hi>Petitio principij:</hi> and the firſt can not be diſpenſed with du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life; for that the <note n="*" place="margin">1. H. 8. c. 13.</note> ſtatute maketh ſuch diſpenſations void, &amp; ſubiecteth the partie vſing them, to a grieuous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie. But where he maketh <hi>Not eating fleſh in Lent</hi> to be a <hi>matter repugnant to the law of God:</hi> whereby he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth ſuch diſpenſation to be vnlawfull, he muſt needs confeſſe that he was in his fit, and knew not what he ſaid: for if to abſteine from fleſh in Lent vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, and by poſitiue and politike ordinance, be (as he ſaith) <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and a matter repugnant to the law of God:</hi> then as it ſéemeth ſhould a diſpenſation to doo it, which reſtoreth the former libertie of eating fleſh, be more agréeable to Gods word, and the more meet to be vſed. But neither ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, nor yet not eating of fleſh at anie time, is of the law of God, <hi>Quia eſca nos non commendat Deo, neque regnum Dei est in cibo &amp; potu, &amp; nihil quod intrat in os coinquinat hominem:</hi> ſo that to diſpenſe herewith, either to eat or not to eat, can not be vnlawfull. And that this obſeruation of fiſhdaies is but a politike conſtitution, it is <note n="*" place="margin">5. Eliz. c. 5.</note> explaned elſewhere by act of parlement: whereby alſo he and others (which ſhall affirme otherwiſe of the intent of the prohibition to eat fleſh on certeine daies) are to be puniſhed as ſpreaders of falſe newes. But at the laſt he ſtumbleth vpon the right interpretation, that the Archbiſhop ordinarilie is but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with matters accuſtomed to be diſpenſed with at the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not then ſimplie, but onelie ſo farre
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:22006:229"/> forth as they were not contrarie or repugnant to the word of God. Whereby he ſtraight inferreth, beſides thoſe which are afore ſpoken vnto, that he is not hereby <hi>Intituled to diſpenſe for ſimonie, <hi>Non reſidencie,</hi> mariages in Lent, &amp;c:</hi> bicauſe thoſe are matters he ſaith <hi>repugnant to the law of God.</hi> Touching ſimonie, it can not be denied but it is a greeuous fault, yet forbidden by the poſitiue law of man onelie, (albeit <hi>Canoniſts</hi> for the moſt part haue deriued it from the offenſe of <hi>Simon Magus)</hi> and hath his grounds and reaſons verie weightilie deduced from the law of God and the light of nature. Notwithſtanding, our author hath almoſt wholie qualified and diſpenſed with it, as much as he could with little honeſtie, in his firſt treatiſe: namelie, <hi>By right of couenants, by the well liking of the people, by a good fire in the hall once in a yeare, and by a ſlyuer of bread at the patrons doore.</hi> But if <hi>Non reſidencie</hi> be againſt the law of God abſolutelie and directlie, and not by euent and conſequence onelie; then muſt it be againſt ſome of the ten commandemeuts: and thereby will it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that as vpon none occaſion, anie of them may be tranſgreſſed, ſo will it be ſinfull for a man vpon anie cauſe whatſoeuer, at anie time to be awaie from his benefice, though it were but an houre, no more than a man may kill for an houres ſpace. Laſtlie, where he affirmeth <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in Lent to be repugnant to Gods law,</hi> and therfore not diſpenſable: except he will acknowledge that he was in his melancholike mood, in a little houſe hard beſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he may happen for this ſaieng to be grauelie cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the elderſhip, where he hanteth. But if the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of marriage for ſome certeine times brawne from the old canons, be but of law poſitiue: why may it not by the ſame authoritie be likewiſe releaſed and diſpenſed with? And in deed the occaſion of ſuch prohibition (at ſome ſolemne times of faſts &amp; praiers) was grounded vpon the ſame reaſon, that the <hi>Diſcipline of France</hi> forbad the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the communion by the new married couple that
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:22006:230"/> daie. Yet he is not thus content to reſt in this interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but muſt haue a fling ſawcilie to traduce the whole par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, as <hi>Falling into two palpable abſurdities,</hi> by want of <hi>foreſight &amp; due examination.</hi> D that they which were in parlement then, had beene powdered but with a little ſalt of that diſcretion and forecaſt, wherewith this man think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he is thoroughlie ſeaſoned! Then no doubt ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous church-plat would haue beene hatched, which as yet is but a caſtle built in the aire, by his owne ſhallow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. The firſt <hi>Abſurditie</hi> in this ſtatute he noteth, in that it is <hi>Left to the Archbiſhops determination, what is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ſcripture, what conuenient for the honour and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the prince, &amp; for the wealth and profit of the realme.</hi> The firſt whereof if it ſhould be attributed to any one man (which for the difficultie of meeting vpon euerie occurrent, and other confuſion in multitudes, cannot indeed conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie be otherwiſe) I doo ſée no cauſe but by common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment, the Archbiſhop may be holden for as ſufficient a man as any one other to decide, what is repugnant or not repugnant to Gods word. Albeit there is no one word in the act, that either yeeldeth the determination hereof, or of the other two vnto him: but rather (as may be collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) the contrarie. For the two bookes of tares, which muſt conteine the rate of euerie ſacultie, that is to paſſe, and which vſuallie before had béene granted at the Sée of <hi>Rome;</hi> are by ſtatute to be ſet downe by the Archbiſhop, the Lord Chancelor, the Lord Treaſurer, and by the two chéefe iuſtices of both benches, for the time being. But in vnaccuſtomed caſes, the Archbiſhop can paſſe no facultie at all, vnleſſe the prince or councell ſhall determine it, and giue licence vnto him ſo to grant. But if all theſe <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties</hi> and <hi>abſurdities</hi> that hitherto to the Abſtractor vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie (as you ſée) hath bungled about, ſhould be granted to be in the ſtatute, yet how could the Minor propoſition hereby be confirmed (which was his purpoſe to prooue) that <hi>It is not conuenient for hir Highneſſe honor and ſuertie, to leaue
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:22006:230"/> any maner of authoritie in the Archbiſhop to diſpenſe.</hi> For there might be ſome parts of the ſtatute, and ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties abſurd, yea all might be ſo; and yet hir honor and ſuertie no waie impeached: for <hi>Vtile per inutile non vitiatur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> that which is to no purpoſe, dooth not hinder that which is to ſome vſe. And if he would haue authoritie of diſpenſing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Archbiſhop, and to be giuen vnto hir Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, in reſpect of vnlawfulneſſe of diſpenſations, how ſhall this be lawfull in hir Highneſſe royall perſon, more than in his? And the vanitie alſo of his <hi>Other abſurditie</hi> is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, which would therefore euerthrow the whole act, bicauſe it is vnſitting, he ſaith, <hi>For a ſubiect to grant a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to his ſouereigne.</hi> But albcit there neither is nor can be ſo frequent an vſe of ſuch diſpenſing with the princes owne perſon, as was when the ſtatute was made, by reaſon manie humane lawes brought in by canons of councels were then throughout all this weſt church ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be in force, euen with ſouereigne princes, as about vowes, marriages within certeine degrees of carnall and ſpirituall (as they termed it) conſanguinitie or affinitie, clandeſtinitie, legitimation of children borne before eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, and ſuch like a number more than now are: yet doo I thinke it too generall ſimplie to be ſet downe, that now there can be no vſe of anie diſpenſations at all for the princes owne perſon, as by examples might be ſhewed, if it were requiſite. For although the perſon of the prince née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not to be diſpenſed with for the poſitiue law of man being made by his direction, according to that <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is a relaxation of law in ſome particular caſe, the bond and ſtrength of it otherwiſe remaining in force:</hi> nor can for the law of God, which no man may releaſe in anie particular mans caſe, the bond of it being perpetuall: yet notwithſtanding I doo not ſee, but by a <hi>Diſpenſation of iuſtice,</hi> which is a true and vpright interpretation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that the law of God, of nature, or of nations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true ſenſe and meaning thereof, hath not
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:22006:231"/> place in ſome particular action, which otherwiſe might in ſhéw appeare to be included in the generalitie of them: that in this reſpect it may be expedient, euen the princes perſon ſundrie times ſo to be prouided for. And this the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bicauſe by law and naturall reaſon <hi>Nemo ſecum diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat,</hi> no man can impart a diſpenſation vnto himſelfe. So that the Archbiſhop in ſuch a weightie caſe, hauing with the beſt learned in the land maturelie debated the matter with all circumſtances, and found vpon pregnant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible reaſons, that it cannot be trulie ſaid to be againſt anie of the former immutable lawes: if then he ſhall <hi>In perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> in autentike forme vnder his ſeale ſet downe this reſolution: it cannot iuſtlie be auowched that the princes honor or prerogatiue is hereby any waie abaſed, but rather the quiet of his mind well prouided for; and the doubts, which in proceſſe of time might here vpon be caſt, wiſelie and godlie to be met with, for the profit and benefit of the realme. Neither can ſuch diſpenſation, touching the princes owne naturall perſon in matter of conſcience, or of ſome poſitiue eccleſiaſticall law, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto him, be any more derogatorie to his honor or royall prerogatiue: than <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7, 4.</note> when the iudges of the land did determine, that the attainder by parlement of the perſon of the noble king <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſeauenth, was vpon his call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the crowne, by the verie operation of the law adnul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and diſcharged. Or when Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> gaue ſentence for the nullitie of marriage contracted betwixt king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, and ladie <hi>Katharine Dowager,</hi> his late brothers wife. Whereby may alſo be perceiued, that the difference, which the Abſtractor taketh betwixt the iudgements of the iuſtices and the diſpenſations of the Archbiſhop, as not touching the kings owne perſon, like as diſpenſations doo, to be deſtitute of footing, or ſound and good ground to ſtand vpon. And although in words he ſéeme outwardlie thus to tender hir Maieſties honour and prerogatiue; yet the place which he alledgeth out of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:22006:231"/> lawe looketh a cleane contrarie waie.

And as it cannot be conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for hir Highnes to attend in perſon the execution here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: ſo hir royall dignitie is no waie impeached by yeelding this authoritie to the Archbiſhop, who muſt (where cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth) performe this dutie but as a miniſter herein to hir Maieſtie and the ſtate: and who cannot diſpenſe as he liſt, but with confirmation vnder the great ſeale of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as the ſtatute dooth limit.

For in this conſtitution it is reported, how by reaſon of a canon made in the councell of <hi>Lyons,</hi> which exacted that within one yere he that would inioy a benefice, ſhould neceſſarilie become préeſt: that few or none which were learned, or meant to increaſe their knowledge, would accept of anie parochiall benefice.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:22006:238"/> Whervpon the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was now vrged to grant vnto Biſhops libertie of diſpenſing for the ſpace of ſeauen yeares, to ſuch as would be ſubdeacons, <hi>De non promouendo,</hi> ſo they continued in ſome place of ſtudie. But what is this to the practiſe of our church, which hath by ſtatute no facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in force for a beneficed perſon with cure of ſoule <hi>De non promouendo.</hi> For he muſt needs be of a certeine age, and a <note place="margin">13.

But I anſwer, that this conſtitution is penall and ſtrict, and therefore not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue anie ſuch extenſion: That the rule that <hi>the ſame reaſon maketh the like law</hi> hath manie limitations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome may be found to be appliable to this caſe, and are touched in the former treatiſe: and laſtlie, that in theſe two faculties the reaſons be not alike.

Yea, the law decideth this controuerſie, by permitting the grant of the one diſpenſation for life, and making the other but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie, which is aboue all diſpute. So that although he that is diſpenſed with to inioy two benefices, be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted directlie to haue a facultie of non reſidence, they two being diuerſe: yet is it by law (<note n="*" place="margin">Gl. in c. in tantum Ext. de Praeb.</note> as to other acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries neceſſarilie conſecutiue, without the which it could not elſe ſort to effect) to be extended alſo to conteine and implie this facultie, <note n="*" place="margin">Gl. in c. non poteſt de prae. in 6.

Firſt, that if diſpenſation be taken for an adminiſtration of iuſtice and right, as it is ſometimes vſed, then is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie collation and inſtitution of a worthie man, a facultie whereby he may inioy the fruits of a pariſh church during life, though not in his abſence which is not here expreſſed: and in this ſenſe his Maior is vntrue, as making all ſuch to be void. Againe, there lurketh a fallacie in the equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word Granted. For if it be vnderſtood of an expreſſe grant to him that ſhall be abſent (as I thinke he meaneth) which is a direct facultie for non reſidence, and be granted by an inferiour ſince the making of that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſidering no abſolute or ſouereigne prince (ſuch as the pope claimeth to be) can thereby be tied otherwiſe than voluntarilie, <hi>Quia par in parem non habet imperium:</hi> then will I grant his concluſion. But if he will extend the word granted ſo far, as to carie all ſuch grants, whether expreſlie ſo conceiued, or but by implication onelie: then is it to be denied as falſe: bicauſe in a diſpenſation for pluralitie, by the ſecret operation of lawe, a faculitie of non reſidence vpon the one or the other benefice is neceſſarilie implied and allowed (without expreſſing) euen during the life of the partie. And therefore there is no cauſe, whie by colluſion or indirectlie, the Archbiſhop ſhould ſeeke (if he were ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in that ſort to gratifie any man) to renew their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of pluralities after ſeauen yeres: ſéeing he may by law grant them for terme of life; which may neceſſarilie be thereof inferred, bicauſe the partie being inſtituted to a perpetuitie in both, and diſpenſed with to reteine and keepe them, it cannot be otherwiſe intended, but that his diſpenſation ſhall laſt ſo long time, as <note n="*" place="margin">

The firſt of the places, which to this purpoſe he bringeth, is either by the printer negligentlie, or by himſelfe ſo peruerſelie quoted, that I haue no direction therby to find it. The other place ſpeketh not of diſpenſing, but of iudging, and decideth that there ſhould lie none appellation, <hi>A praefecto praetorio,</hi> being the chéefeſt officer vnder the Emperor, and not much vnlike the L.

Now to prooue that the parlement, which by act authorized the Archbiſhop to diſpenſe, would not grant a facultie for two benefices, though all externall circumſtances conſiſting in fact, were in ſpecialtie trulie recounted without concealment of any point materiall &amp; requiſite therein to be knowne: he hath deuiſed a proper new matter and interlude with diuerſe interlocutors, neuer plaid before: wherin he plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the parts himſelfe, and one beſides. By which in effect he muſt for his purpoſe collect thus: The parlement would not grant to ſome man a diſpenſation for the retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of two benefices, Therefore it will denie vnto all men. Or thus: To him which hath ſufficient alreadie, they of the parlement would denie, Therefore the Archbiſhop ought alſo to denie. The firſt dooth not follow, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent of the ſecond is not neceſſarilie true. <label type="milestone">

Touching the next and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, though the diſpenſations we handle, were ſuch as ought to be granted according to the ſtrict courſe of proceeding in lawe: yet one of the foure cauſes (which is ſufficient) being ſo eaſie to be prooued (as he himſelfe dooth confeſſe) we ſhall not need to expect a concurrence of them all, as he muſt either here haue inſinuated to be requiſite, or elſe muſt yeeld, that he talketh impertinentlie to the matter.

But bicauſe it is more profitable for the people of two pariſhes, to haue a learned man ſometimes to inſtruct them, and he thereby to be well mainteined: than that they ſhould be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to two ſeuerall men, though abiding with them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie, yet not able to preach to anie purpoſe vnto them. And both the conſecution hereof, and the thing it ſelfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the number of congregations, and the raritie (in
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:22006:243"/> compariſon of them all) of able preachers in England, is or may be notorious to the world. Yea, and they are forced to take the like courſe for want of able preachers in other reformed churches abroad, as in Holland, Zeland, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places at this day, where I wis they haue not all their miniſters learned and able preachers: but ſundrie ſimple (though godlie) artiſans to ſerue in their meaner congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. And if he tell vs here, it were better in this caſe to haue an vnion; though this cannot ſo be caſt, that either the people may or will come togither to one place, but that euen then there muſt be chapels for eaſier reſort in winter, and for the elder and weaker ſort at all times, (which is all one in effect with Pluralitie, ſéeing the auditorie receiueth partition:) yet it were more thanke-worthie in him, or in any other that could deuiſe a plat, not onelie how all theſe and other difficulties, and the inconueniences of innouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be met with in theſe vnions: but alſo the meanes how it might be compaſſed, that patrones ſhould willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie relinquiſh their inheritance herein, or ioine it according to this deuiſe with others, <hi>Per alternas, ternas, aut quaternas vices:</hi> or how it may ſtand with reaſon, to breake the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and teſtators wils in this caſe, more than in the other. In his entrance into the third point, he contrarieth his <note place="margin">Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie.</note> owne ſaiengs as well afore, where he aſſured the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners they ſhould find Manie diſpenſations vpon omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome circumſtances to be void, and thervpon their benefices void: as here where he ſaith: The moſt part of diſpenſations to be nothing in effect at all.

But in the fourth and laſt place he preſſeth vs with authoritie of The Lords ſeruants, who ſpeake againſt them, preach againſt them, and write againſt them. Indeed a man may be the Lords ſeruant, and ſo doo: though thereby it dooth not follow, that either they doo well and aduiſedlie therein; or that they perfectlie vnderſtand the matter, and the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the cauſe, or that therefore the thing is impious and wicked. I haue knowne as great &amp; greater exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vſed againſt meere indifferent things, (now by them confeſſed ſo to be) as though they had béene either ſimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie impious, or ſo fowlie abuſed that they could not haue any tollerable vſe, euen by as godlie and learned men as theſe are, which now he ſpeaketh of. But it is the abuſe of ſome few careleſſe men, and not of the matter it ſelfe which giueth occaſion of that offenſe which is taken: and it were vnreaſonable, bicauſe caterpillers ſome yeare haue bred in your orchards, in that reſpect to hew downe all your trees. The philoſopher ſaith: Whatſoeuer hath his vſe, may be abuſed, ſauing vertue. And ſo, whatſoeuer may be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, being not ſimplie vicious and wicked, may be well v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And it is not the continuall aboad amongſt their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhoners (which none of them all doo) nor the often, but the ſound, orderlie, and pithie preaching vpon neceſſarie points, that diſchargeth the dutie of the paſtor, who may be in truth as bad as Non reſident, though he were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie nailed to the pulpit, as Luther once pleaſantlie ſpake of Pomeran. And thoſe which by following this theame, doo
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:22006:244"/> ſhoot at nothing elſe, but to tie vp a good and learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, to a petit and meane ſalarie by yeare: let them be aſſured, that deſolation of the exact ſtudie of diuinitie, and other good learning, whereby onelie the papiſt, and other heretikes are ſuppreſſed, and barbariſme is kept out, will follow after a beggerlie and contemptuous cleargie, when as by their liuing they ſhall be ſcarſe able to find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and their families: and therefore much leſſe be able to furniſh themſelues with ſuch bookes as are requiſite to atteine vnto any exactneſſe or maturitie in learning. The lamentable experience of which decaie of learning, by the ſmalneſſe of church liuings, ſome notable churches and common-weales of the other ſide do alreadie partlie féele, but the wiſer ſort of them doo more feare to ſmart for, hereafter. And therefore, where the Abſtractor aſſumeth, that the cauſe and reaſon wherevpon ſuch diſpenſations were vſed, dooth ceaſe, and would thereby gather that the effect ſhould ceaſe: I ſaie, that when he or any other ſhall haue prooued, that not onelie ſome one cauſe thereof, but all the cauſes; and not <note n="*" place="margin">Arg. l. 1. §. ſextan ff. de poſtulando.</note> onelie the impulſiue, but alſo the finall cauſes of it are ceaſed: then (as law willeth) I muſt grant the act in that point to be laid on ſleepe, and not to be put in vre, till ſome of the ſame cauſes ſhall happen againe. But beſides his owne aſſurances, which are ſure and good inough, for anie ſuch as will truſt him vpon ſo ſufficient ſecuritie: he inforceth this matter by the words Of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer (he ſaith) of ſingular iudgement. Whereas now for any thing we know of him at his hands he may be who he will: peraduenture the famous Grangouſier, grand-father to prince Pantagruel, or ſome ſuch great renowmed clearke as he was ſaid to be, which firſt in this world deuiſed to plaie at dice with a paire of ſpectacles on his noſe.

So that, if hereby there ariſe no diminution, and the taxe for the diſpenſation be an increaſe of the reuenues, then ſhall the Abſtractors argument <hi>Ab vtili,</hi> be found to be ſcarſe to his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie and credit.
